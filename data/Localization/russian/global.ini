Bacchus_Desc=Многие в ОЗИ верят, что в системе двойной звезды Бахус находится родной мир Бану, хотя сами Бану до сих пор так и не смогли (а может просто не захотели) тем или иным образом подтвердить эту гипотезу. Торговые пути здесь, как и в большинстве других систем Бану, всегда наполнены путешественниками, прилетающими с территорий Бану, людей или Шиан. На задворках системы постоянно дислоцируется крупная флотилия, которая является популярным пунктом назначения для торговцев и перевозчиков.\n
Bacchus_Flotilla=Флотилия Бахуса
Bacchus_Flotilla_Desc=Крупное скопление кораблей, ставшее постоянным летающим рынком. Флотилия очень удобно расположена вблизи прыжковой точки, и поэтому она привлекает большое количество путешественников и торговцев, посещающих и покидающих систему.

Cano=Cano System
Cano1=Cano I
Cano1_Desc=This tidally locked mesoplanet rapidly orbits the central star.\n
Cano2=Carteyna
Cano2_Desc=For centuries, geoengineers had tried to terraform this ocean planet with little success due to the difficulty in converting its relatively thick atmosphere, however all attempts were halted when microscopic organism were discovered deep in the water and Carteyna was placed under protective restrictions. Seeking to guard the developing indigenous life form, planetary settlements are strictly regulated.
Cano3=Cano III
Cano3_Desc=Home to a small research station looking into terraforming smog planets.\n

Castra2=Cascom
Castra2_Desc=Originally settled as a forward military base and training facility, Castra II was cleared for civilian habitation after the collapse of the Messer Era. 
Castra_Desc=Zoned as a staging area for Naval bombers, Castra was a key military position along the Perry Line during the Xi'an/Human tensions of 2530-2789. Once the Akari Treaty was recognized by Imperator Toi, the UEE military largely demilitarized the system and opened it for public habitation. Castra experienced a boom in population thanks to the inexpensive real estate that opened up in the wake of the military's departure.\n

Covalex_Danger_001=One more thing, I'm seeing here that you'll be working in a heightened safety area. I'm sure you always follow best practices, but a little extra caution probably wouldn't be a bad idea. Better safe than sorry, right! 
Covalex_Danger_002=One last thing, it looks like some of our previous operators have reported outlaw activity in the area. Might be a good idea to plan for some extra security precautions. But if you do get into a situation (though you probably won't!), remember Covalex's policy of 'Flight, not fight.' 
Covalex_Danger_003=Also, unfortunately, it seems a security flag has been placed on this contract. Nothing to worry about too much... but that said, you should probably at least be extra careful during this job. Be ready for anything and you'll never be surprised! 
Covalex_Danger_004=One more little wrinkle. The system has flagged this contract as potentially hazardous. It might not mean anything, but don't be too surprised if you run into a bump or two or three while completing this one. 
Covalex_Danger_005=Last thing. This contract has been given a security flag. They add those when there is a higher risk involved. Sometimes it's hazardous routes, sometimes outlaw sightings, but you're going to want to be extra sharp on this one.

Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_001=You haven't been having much luck out there have you? I don't want to get too overly dramatic, but your performance stats over the last few contracts have been falling well below average. However, your luck hasn't completely run out! Covalex believes firmly in cultivating talent and allowing people to learn from our mistakes ( Thankfully! I probably wouldn't be here otherwise :p ). So, let's put all that behind us as a learning experience and meet the future head on! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadStreak_002=This is part of my job that I do not look forward to. We have to talk about your recent string of contracts. Things have just not been going your way have they? I'm not gonna sugar coat it, your performance stats are not look so hot. But you know what they say, nothing makes up for the past like the present. Let's get you back out there, and see what you can really do. 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Got to say, you really turned it around with that last job! Awesome work! Now, let's just keep it up! 
Covalex_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Congrats on the flipping your performance status around! I was rooting for you, and sure enough, you really proved on that last job that when push comes to shove, you can get it done. Now we just got to keep that momentum going! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_001=Hate to do this, but wanted to check in about that last contract. Seems like you had some problems. Now, while we all run into unavoidable obstacles from time to time, I'm going to encourage you to take a moment to think about what went wrong and three things that you can improve upon for your next contract. It's a little exercise that always helps me improve my performance, and isn't that what life is about? Self improvement? All right, back to the exciting new business at hand! 
Covalex_Reaction_Bad_002=To get a bit of business out of the way, I briefly wanted to mention your performance on the last contract. I have in my notes that it was less than satisfactory. Probably just an off day, and I sure know about those, but I would like to strongly encourage you to use this contract as an opportunity to show us just how good you really are. 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=I was looking back through my records and wow! You've been doing a fantastic job recently. I've talked about you to some of the other Jr. Logistics Operators, and you didn't hear it from me, but they're pretty jealous I'm working with such a stellar contractor. Keep this up and we'll both be Covalex stars! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=First off, I want to let you know how much I, and everyone here at Covalex Shipping, really appreciate the hard work you've been putting in. You've consistently have been completing contracts above and beyond my expectations. Alright, that's probably enough stroking your ego! 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=I'm going to confess, I was a little surprised seeing that report come in from your last contract. You had been doing so well! For now, let's just call it a fluke and focus on the next job, okay? 
Covalex_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=I have to ask - were you as disappointed about that last contract as I was? You had such a good record going! But don't worry. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what we do with those mistakes that matter. It's like that saying - "I'd rather try and fail, than fail to try." 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_001=My records show that you did a great job with that last contract! I personally wanted to say well done. It's that kind of performance that Covalex really loves to see. 
Covalex_Reaction_Good_002=Wanted to take a second to say that you did a stellar job with that last contract and that your hard work is not going unnoticed! 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So, with your recent performance issues, I'm afraid that if you don't turn things around, Covalex will be putting you on a probationary disciplinary period and remove you from active contractor status. But don't worry, this contract is you're chance show us how dedicated you are to meeting Covalex Shipping's high standards. I'm sure you'll do great. 
Covalex_Reaction_LastWarning_002=There's a bit of bad news. I've received notice that your time with Covalex may be transitioning to a less 'active' role. Seems that your track record hasn't been all that satisfactory. Good news is that it's not too late for you to change people's minds! You knock this next contract into the goal, and it'll show you still have some tricks up your sleeves. 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_001=I know it's been a little while since we last spoke, but I'm happy to report that my manager has agreed to allow you to do another 'Evaluation Trial' to regain active status as a Covalex Independent Contractor. I'm a firm believer in giving people another chance to prove themselves, and this is yours! 
Covalex_Reaction_Renew_002=I've got some good news. We were directed to go through our probationary contractors list and see if there were candidates who we felt deserved to be reconsidered. You immediately came to mind! What do you say? You ready to wipe the slate clean and give it another try? 
Covalex_SignOff_001=Thanks in advance for ensuring prompt service,
Covalex_SignOff_002=Good luck out there!
Covalex_SignOff_003=Talk to you soon,
Covalex_SignOff_004=And as the poster on my wall says, 'Bee Safe, Honey!'
Covalex_SignOff_005=Can't wait to hear how everything goes,
Covalex_SignOff_006=Have a good one,
Covalex_SignOff_007=Happy travels and fly safe!
Covalex_SignOff_008=I'm rooting for you. Make me proud!
Covalex_Timed_001=The order has been flagged as a 'Rush Priority' job, so you will be expected to complete the contract within the designated window. Hope that won't be a problem. 
Covalex_Timed_002=There is a tight deadline on this contract, so be sure to keep an eye on the clock. 
Covalex_Timed_003=Plus, we need everything wrapped up by a specific deadline. Got to keep the customers happy! 
Covalex_Timed_004=This will be a 'Rush Priority' job. That means that we can't afford any delays. 
Covalex_Timed_005=The customer requested 'Rush Priority' so you will have to keep a close eye on the time while you're working.

Crus_HistMarker_From=Crusader Historical Society
Crus_HistMarker_Text_01=Famed musician Carolyn 'Vortex' Thorson was born here on January 8, 2915. Her family's ship was en route to a nearby outpost when it set down to facilitate her birth. As a teenager, Thorson earned the nickname 'Vortex' for the impressive speed and dexterity she displayed behind the drums. As a founding member of Firmament, she helped redefine popular music, making her the most famous and mimicked drummer in the UEE for over a decade.   
Crus_HistMarker_Text_02=Rayari scientists working here at the Hickes Research Outpost created a revolutionary nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) in 2938. The drug, known commonly as Ceprozin, has become widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries, providing pain relief and curbing inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_03=Here, in 2941, Terra Mills researchers combined Cellin's unique soil composition with genetic augmentation to create a new fruit hybrid named the Terraberry. This uniquely tart, purple berry stays ripe longer than most other berries, making it ideal for interstellar shipping.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_04=Here sits the shelter that saved Bastien Nemitz. In 2930, Crusader Industries hired the noted adventurer to promote the beauty and diversity of their moons by hiking around each one and providing daily updates. Following successful journeys around Cellin and Yela, Nemitz failed to upload a daily diary from Yela on June 24th. A search party was organized but failed to find him. Days later, Nemitz contacted Crusader authorities from this shelter. He'd limped here on a shattered ankle suffering during a terrible fall that also destroyed his mobi. After he was rescued, Nemitz recovered and returned to the Talarine Divide shelter to complete his journey around Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_05=This shelter was erected in part due to the generous contributions of Ethan Halton's friends and families. The large boulders and rocks that dot the Nakamura Valley have made it a popular destination for unregulated open canopy racers. Sadly, in 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton, unable to handle the track's successive tight turns, died from injuries sustained during a racing crash. To help ensure that other racers would not share Ethan's fate, in 2918, this emergency shelter was erected.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_06=Mario Kosso was the first head of Crusader's emergency response unit. Established to provide support and rescue services to those who found themselves in need on Crusader's moons, Kosso lead the response to the team's first distress beacon, which came from this basin. It was named in his honor upon his retirement in 2938.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_07=The famous picture of Yela's ring illuminated against the darkened sky was taken here by noted photographer Juliana Aston in 2918. The vista became so connected to her artwork that in 2928 it was officially named 'Aston Ridge' in her honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_08=Situated above a junction of multiple canyons, Wolf Point earned its name thanks to Crusader surveyor Cally Stroble who had noted excitedly in her initial report that "Against all odds, it seems a family of wolf-like creatures somehow has found a way to settle the area. Their cries can be heard for kilometers around." However, when further investigation proved that the wolves were merely a prank by a fellow surveyor, the name stuck.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_09=This ridge was named for Crusader's former CEO August Dunlow. Many credit Dunlow's vision as instrumental into transforming Crusader Industries into the company it is today. With that in mind, Dunlow Ridge, with its expansive view of the Daymar landscape, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_10=This section of Daymar became known as Eager Flats after an eccentric artist who called it home. Norman Eager gained notoriety in the 2920s for constructing a series of art installations so massive they could be seen by ships flying above the flats. Deemed 'ephemeral art' by Eager, the pieces were not meant to be permanent. Instead, they were slowly degraded and buried by the moon's constantly swirling sands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_11=The Tamdon Plains were named in honor of Advocacy agent Crista Tamdon, who in 2912 was killed in the line of duty after being ambushed while crossing these plains in pursuit of a suspect.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_12=From 2923 to 2927, a mysterious benefactor took it upon themselves to see that this emergency shelter was stocked with jars of homemade marmalade. First reported by a stranded pilot, as word spread many other travelers would visit the shelter to try the jam for themselves. In 2927, when a reporter attempted to learn who was leaving the sweet treat, the marmalade supply stopped as mysteriously as it began. However, the tradition has been kept alive to this day by the many visitors who continue to leave preserves at the site.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_13=Crusader's former lead ship designer, Shelly Ashburn, became enamored with this location for its picturesque angle of Crusader on the horizon. She often visited the spot to channel her creative energy, earning it the nickname, Ashburn Channel, among her team. Following her retirement in 2940, the site officially adopted the title.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_14=In 2936, Crusader Industries sponsored a competition to find the best travelogue focused on one of their moons. Donnell Flanagan's account of his exciting experiences took top prize and this location, which featured heavily in his adventures, was named in his honor.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_15=Crusader CEO Kelly Caplan loved the landscape on this part of Cellin and requested that this ravine be named for her dog, Julep.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_16=Here on August 25th, 2912, Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first ground vehicle race on Yela. The track became famous among ground vehicle racing enthusiasts and subsequently the site of the first official race track on the moon.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_17=On this site in 2906, Darnell Ajay built the first permanent homestead on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_18=On this site in 2906, Phillip Xu built the first permanent homestead on Cellin.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_19=On this site in 2907, Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead on Yela.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_20=Advocacy agents, alongside Hurston and Crusader Security forces, pursued Amir Tremaine after he crash-landed into this canyon on Oct. 23, 2929. The wanted fugitive used pieces of his ship to hastily construct a makeshift fortification. Thus began a dramatic, three-day standoff against law enforcement officers which garnered non-stop spectrum coverage up until the final, bloody moments when the Advocacy tried but failed, to take Tremaine alive.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_21=Here on October 2nd, 2904, Chad Fawley ended the first successful solo, circumnavigation of Cellin in a ground vehicle.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_22=In 2934, Esther Hurston was kidnapped and put into a stasis pod by outlaws looking to extract a hefty ransom from her family. The ship holding the twelve-year-old's cryo-pod hid here after its reg-tags were compromised. While one outlaw attempted to procure clean reg-tags, salvager Mac Petrosky discovered the ship. He reported its location and even hid nearby to keep an eye on the ship until authorities arrived on the scene. Petrosky was awarded a Commendation from Crusader Security upon the reunion of Esther and her family.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_23=The infamous Beringer Brothers nicknamed this the "Goodbye Geyser" after repeatedly using it to dispose of those opposed to their criminal enterprises during the early 2920s. It's believed to be the final resting place for at least 14 individuals including famed bounty hunter, Bree Kuznetsov. Attempts to recover remains from the site have proven unsuccessful.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_24=Here in 2909, famed botanist Bryan Shakir began his work cataloguing the diverse flora of Daymar. Published as "Daymar in Bloom: A Flora Field Guide to Stanton 2b," it is still considered by many to be the definitive source on the subject.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_25=Erma Triolo was born on this site in 2909, making her the first person to be born on Yela. Her parents, Albert and Nora Triolo, had traveled to the moon to participate in a race when Nora went into labor. Unable to fly to the nearest medical facilitate for the birth, Albert landed their Constellation at this location and successfully served as midwife.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_26=Prior to Crusader's purchase of the gas giant and its moons, the UEE Navy controlled this part of the system. Here, in 2904, the UEE Navy established a military installation to support and watch over the shipyards perched in Crusader's upper atmosphere. The facilities were retired and relocated in 2908.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_27=Strained relations between Hurston and their workforce in late 2927-2929 resulted in a series of riots. In response, Hurston severely limited traffic to and from the planet for nearly 15 standard months. Many workers wished to escape the dangerous situation, but few had the means. One bright spot was the Hurston Hotline, a comm channel that constantly shifted frequency. Those looking to flee the unrest, and lucky enough to know the current channel frequency, could request help leaving the planet. Specific instructions were delivered in person to volunteer pilots and had to be followed exactly. The network of labor activists responsible for the Hurston Hotline during this tumultuous time used this location to shelter fleeing workers prior to moving them out of the system.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_28=Cellin was named after the youngest sibling in the classic children's story A Gift for Baba,the moon's many dormant volcanoes embodying the character's simmering anger. This dormant volcano, named Cellin's Peak by volcanologists, is carefully watched and monitored as it is believed to have a high chance of one day becoming active. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_29=Daymar was named after the middle brother in A Gift for Baba. Known for his tendency to get lost, the character's name was also given to this twisting canyon by early explorers. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_30=Yela was named after the eldest sibling in A Gift for Baba, who is known for her cool and calculated demeanor. This expansive plain produced the coldest temperature recorded by the first scientific expedition to the moon, earning it the name Yela's Plain. 
Crus_HistMarker_Text_31=The study of Cellin's geysers began with an observation station constructed on this location in 2908. Geologist Randell Engler spent nearly a decade investigating these natural wonders. He was first to hypothesize that the moon's geyser played an important role in dispersing vital nutrients and minerals into the soil.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_32=During Imperator Costigan's 2944 trip to the Stanton System, he shared a meal here at Gallete Family Farms. Imperator Costigan hoped his visit would draw attention to the hardworking, independent farmers across the Empire that would benefit from the agricultural subsidies legislation being debated by the Senate at the time.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_33=In 2927, Fakih Borisov introduced a herd of large, genetically modified land crabs to Daymar. Breed to withstand the moon's dry conditions, the crabs roamed this part of Daymar for nearly a decade, but Borisov's dream of turning the moon into a rancher's paradise never came to fruition. A key component to Borisov's plan was for the crab to graze on the moon's limited natural vegetation, yet doing so imbued the animals with an off-putting odor that clung to any products derived from them.  
Crus_HistMarker_Text_34=On August 22, 2924, amateur archaeologist Sonny Pak revealed a fossil that he claimed belonged to a new sentient species that inhabited this moon. News of the discovery spread across the spectrum and excited the scientific community. However, instead of allowing scientists to examine the specimen, Sonny took the remains on a publicity tour and even sold tickets to those who wished to view them. His actions were condemned by the scientific community and, after the intervention of the UEE government, the fossil was proven to be a fake.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_35=Romantics believe that lovers who profess their affection for each other on this ledge will be together forever. This legend has its origin in the macabre tale of notorious outlaw couple Akiko 'Jackal' Bazin and Rick 'Shady' Milligan. In 2913, mere moments away from capture, the pair decided to avoid imprisonment and instead leapt to their death while holding hands.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_36=On December 31, 2940, the Stanton Knights sataball team landed here so their ship could undergo emergency repairs. While waiting, the team strategized for their championship match against the Kiel Guardians scheduled for the following day. According to team members, it was here that the Knights conceived of the now famous 'Franklin Flip' play that would propel the team to victory and the first SBPL championship in the club's history.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_37=On March 17, 2904, Meiko Norwood collapsed here while loading soil samples into her ship. She passed away later that day due to complications with an artificial heart valve, making her the first person to die on Daymar.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_38=In 2939, Crusader Security apprehended a fugitive here who was wanted in connection with a massive theft of credit chits. The money wasn't recovered during the arrest, but rumors swirled that the outlaw was in possession of digging implements. Ever since, treasure hunters have flocked here in search of the lost fortune, even though repeated scans have failed to show any sign of it. \n\nCrusader Industries discourages people from digging up the area and asks that any displaced ground be placed back where it came from to preserve the moon's natural beauty.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_39=The long lost Greg Caldwell painting "The Starman's Farewell" was discovered buried underneath a stone cairn on this site in 2908. Stolen from the Terra Museum of Contemporary Art in 2731, it remains a mystery as to how the work of art ended up here. The painting was returned to Terra.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_40=In 2945, independent miner Bruce Amodeo discovered a large serendibite gemstone near this outpost. Its sale at auction to an anonymous buyer broke records for the most credits per carat spent on a serendibite. Ever since, miners have flocked to the region in search of further serendibite deposits.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_41=Tragedy struck the Cuadrado outpost on May 15, 2941, due to a malfunctioning life support system. An excess of oxygen leaking into the outpost was sparked, resulting in an explosion that took nine lives. The catastrophe drove Crusader Industries to tighten regulations on outposts and mandate more frequent maintenance checks on all facilities.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_42=Crusader Industries commends Bountiful Harvest Hydroponics for their extraordinary response to those in need on Vega. Following the horrific Vanduul attacks on October 5, 2945, Bountiful Harvest produced and donated more emergency food supplies for the Vega relief effort than any other outpost on Crusader's moons. This outpost's extraordinary sacrifice serves as a reminder that the UEE will always stand behind those who come face-to-face with the Vanduul threat.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_43=Famed actress and noted naturist, Millicent Silverton, would often come to this remote area to camp in the wilderness. She was so fond of the site that she petitioned for its inclusion in the 2941 film "Onto the Break."
Crus_HistMarker_Text_44=The geysers here feature a unique set of small fissures, that when the pressure builds up to a specific amount, make a sound similar to moaning. It is this phenomenon that has lead to the erroneous rumors that the site is haunted.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_45=In 2932, this site hosted the infamous Slim Chance Rally. This gathering of Greycat buggy enthusiasts come together once a year in a remote location to compete in an illicit destruction derby.
Crus_HistMarker_Text_46=Crusader Industries often uses this location and its irregular terrain to field test their new ship designs' landing systems. It was here on March 25th, 2934, that the first and only landing of the failed Juno ship design occurred.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_explanationTraining_0450_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Explanation=Rolling is a great way to orient your ship to fit through tight gaps or evade incoming fire. Now you give it a go.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_barrel_roll_introTraining_0430_Flight_Barrel_Roll_Intro=Moving on. Now this is my favorite part of training: the barrel roll.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_autoTraining_0880_Landing_Mode_Auto_Engage_Decoupled=Remember, entering Landing Mode will automatically Decouple your ship, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad as it cuts down your speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_reminder_manualTraining_0890_Landing_Mode_Manual_Engage_Decoupled=The flight system automatically cuts down on your speed when you deploy the landing gear, so don't activate it too far away from the landing pad.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_decoupled_warningTraining_0820_Combat_Decoupled_Mode_Intro_02=It's a great way to dissuade a pursuer, but make sure you've checked your path ahead first.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_deviate_from_landingTraining_0950_Landing_Deviate_From_Landing=If you raise you landing gear or stray too far from the pad, you'll have to request it again.

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_space_brake_introTraining_1110_Flight_Space_Brake_Explanation=If you need to cut speed in a hurry, use your space brake - it's much quicker than dialing back your engines and the moment you let go of it you'll automatically accelerate back up to your previous speed.
Dlg_SC_Tutorial_spire_fillerTraining_1470_Filler_And_Foreshadow_The_Spire=That, my friend, is the Spire. Isn't she a beauty?

Dlg_SC_Tutorial_target_hud_explanation_2Training_0490_Combat_Target_Enemy_Hud_Explanation_02=Shields are drawn as panels floating around the ship. They'll shrink as they weaken until they disappear completely. At that point, your shots will hit the hull and cause lasting damage.

Ellis=Ellis System
Ellis1=Ellis I
Ellis10=Bombora
Ellis10_Desc=The second gas giant in Ellis system, Ellis X features a consistently turbulent atmosphere. It was this chaotic nature that led to its local nickname of Bombora.
Ellis11=Ellis XI recently suffered a cataclysmic collision with one of its moons. Astrophysicists speculate that the planet will continue to splinter and ultimately form a new asteroid belt.
Ellis11_Desc=
Ellis12=Judecca
Ellis12_Desc=A ball of ice, Ellis XII (also known as Judecca) is occasionally used for ice-mining expeditions.
Ellis13=Pinecone\n
Ellis13_Desc=Though technically not a planet, Ellis XIII is considered a local mascot. This protoplanet's unique shape has given it the nickname Pinecone.
Ellis1_Desc=This protoplanet is a scorched, barren ball of rock and bubbling magma due to its extreme proximity to the star. While the possibility exists that there are major deposits of minerals on the planet, mining them would be far too risky.
Ellis2=Ellis II
Ellis2_Desc=Ellis II's large size, proximity to its sun, and surprisingly thick atmosphere has left its entire surface a massive desert, marked with strange swirls and ridges created by frequent massive storms on the planet's surface.
Ellis3=Green
Ellis3_Desc=The vast oceanic world is mostly known as the primary resort destination for racegoers who enjoy Green's high-end mega-resorts. In an effort to protect the elaborate underwater reefs, ships landing on the planet are directed towards specific landing zones.
Ellis4=Kampos
Ellis4_Desc=Named after the large sea creatures that once stalked its deep oceans, Kampos was the first world settled and continues to boast the highest population center in the system.
Ellis5=Noble
Ellis5_Desc=The emerald jewel of the system, Noble is known for the vast stretches of woodland, evoking many comparisons to an undeveloped Earth. The local Governors Council has made sustaining the planet's natural beauty a priority.
Ellis5a=Ellis 5a
Ellis5a_Desc=The regolith of this moon is slightly pink, making it a popular subject for lunar photography.
Ellis5b=Ellis 5b
Ellis5b_Desc=A tidally locked moon, the planet-facing side is pristine while the star-facing side is pocked with craters. 
Ellis6_Desc=A terrestrial planet located just outside the system's green band. Although the planet is technically uninhabited, Ellis VI has been used to conduct studies about human habitation.
Ellis7_Desc=A corrosive and poisonous atmosphere covers this planet making it impossible to terraform or even land on.
Ellis8_Desc=The smallest planet in the system, Ellis VIII boasts a micro atmosphere and little else.\n
Ellis9=Walleye
Ellis9_Desc=Nicknamed Walleye by long-distance haulers, Ellis IX is a swirling gas giant that intermittently suffers from massive storms visible from space.
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1=Ellis Belt Alpha
Ellis_AsteroidBelt1_Desc=Perhaps the best known asteroid belt in the UEE, the Ellis Belt became famous for being a Murray Cup racetrack. Over the years, the Murray Cup has sought to acquire all rights to the belt, making mining strictly prohibited.     \n
Ellis_Desc=This thirteen-planet system contains a wide habitable zone thanks to its F-type main sequence star. Ellis is mostly known as the home of the UEE's most famous race, the Murray Cup. What began as way to kill time during the terraforming process has become big business; fueling the economy for the three terraformed planets -- Green (Ellis III), Kampos (Ellis IV), and Noble (Ellis V). Ellis' eleventh planet recently collided with its moon, leaving an asteroid belt in the former orbital path.

Hadrian_Desc=Known as "No Man's Land", Hadrian's location near Xi'an space made it a militarily strategic system during the cold war. Now it is famous for being a main shipping checkpoint between the UEE and Xi'an Empire. Travelers are advised to stay in the system's safe space lanes, which are demarcated by buoys. Those who ignore the space lanes are liable to encounter unexploded anti-ship mines left over from the cold war.\n
Hadrian_Flotilla=Kedsu Reef
Hadrian_Flotilla_Desc=On the lagrange point of Hadrian II, there's a mini-mall cluster of former military stations that have been converted into a massive bazaar. Some newer trade stations have opened in recent years as the site has become a mecca of trade to the Xi'an.

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \n\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \n\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\n\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us. Well, whenever you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.\n\n-	J     \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Three runs. I’ve done three runs for you and still haven’t gotten paid. You aren’t the only ones with debts to pay and while this may be your family business, it sure as hell isn’t mine.  \n\nMaybe if you guys actually made sure your clients paid on time this wouldn’t happen. More than once I’ve seen Jameis tell clients to pay him whenever it’s convenient. Guess I shouldn’t be surprised this happened. Freund Family Fuel may be fine with doing a hard day’s work and not getting paid, but the hell if I am. I’ll be filing a breach of contract or lost wages complaint or whatever the hell they’re called against you both the second I’m off this tub. \n\n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

JournalEntry_CrewMember_03_Description=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n/**Comm_Transcription**/\n\nTo: Ben Totland\nFrom: Simon Totland\nRE: Checking in\n\nHey man,\n\nI got chewed out again today. Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \n\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\n\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \n\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \n\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship. Sure Mom would love it too. Both her boys, exploring the stars together. Just like she always dreamed. \n\nCrap … gotta run. Talk again soon, brother.   \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I’ve done a full assessment of the ship in its current state and come to a ballpark value. It … well, there’s a lot more work to be done around here than I first thought. I added about half a dozen other fixes to my punch list today... you know what, we should probably talk about this in person. That way I can explain how I got to my total. Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\n\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\n\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \n\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \n\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it. She definitely won’t like it, but you owe her that much.  \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \n\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \n\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans. Just give me the time and I’ll give you this system. \n\nI’ll be in touch next week. \n\n-	Patricia    \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I don’t have to tell you how important it is for the company that our expansion into the system succeeds. \n\nWith that in mind, I must say that I have my concerns over how Ms. Sarafian is handling the situation. One of my main problems in making an educated assessment is a lack of good information. Ms. Sarafian, despite a number of subtle and not to subtle requests, only submits her required weekly report for me to review. \n\nThat’s where I was hoping you could come in. For here forward, I need you to provide me with a day-by-day accounting of Avivar’s happenings in the system without informing Ms. Sarafian that you are doing so. I reviewed your personnel file and see that you have been an excellent Avivar employee over the years. Since you have been so good to us, you can expect Avivar to be good to you for your assistance and discretion in this matter. \n\n-	MD \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I was just on the bridge for the last few hours, bored outta my mind, and it hit me like a lightning bolt. Had to sneak away so I could get this idea to you before I forgot it. \n\nWhat if, at the end of the party scene, we reveal the ship has a smuggler’s compartment that Hector didn’t know about. So he’s had the magical relic on board the entire time. That’s why the pirates don’t want to damage the ship and destroy what’s onboard. \n\nPlus, it gives ‘em a reason to board the ship and take him hostage instead of blowing him out of the sky. Then we can keep that scene we love where he’s locked in that cell and ...\n\nI gotta run. Cap keeps yelling for me over comm. But you get the idea, right?

Journal_General_ContractManagerTutorial_Content=Welcome to the new Contract Manager!\n\nWith your mobiGlas’ 2.5 network software update, you may have noticed some improvements made to the Contract Manager application. It’s now easier to search through available jobs, accept contracts, and keep all your ongoing work organized. Happy Job Hunting!\n_______________________________________\n\nKEEPING TABS\n\nThe first thing you may notice when you open the Contract Manager from the mG Homespace is that there are now four tabs located along the top of your holo-display.\n\nGeneral - This tab gathers and displays available local contracts which have been Business and Labor Administration (BLA) certified to meet UEE and local law requirements.  \nPersonal - These are offers being sent to your account specifically. Users are encouraged to be cautious accepting unsolicited contracts from unknown sources.\nAccepted - Once you accept an offer, the contract is moved to this tab so that you can quickly access important information relating to it.\nHistory - When a contract comes to end, either through successful completion or by other means, the record of it is kept here for reference.\n\nNEW CONTRACT CATEGORIES\n\nWe have introduced new Contract Categories that automatically group offers by type to make it easier to find the type of job you’re interested in. \n\nAppointments - These are typically offers used to coordinate and schedule in person meetings.\nBounty Hunter - Contracts to pursue and track down specific, possibly dangerous individuals.\nECN - Contracts received through the Emergency Communication Network system.\nDelivery - Transport-related contracts to move cargo and goods between locations.\nInvestigation - Used by insurance companies and individuals to acquire information. (This update also improves the data submission tool to allow users to submit applicable information to the client from the Accepted tab*.)\nMaintenance - Jobs that require manual labor and trade skills such as repair work or hazardous material handling. \nMercenary - Offers in which the contractor is expected to have combat training, such as escort and security work.\n\nACCEPTING CONTRACTS\n\nWith the Contract Manager, after carefully reading all the information, you can apply for and accept job offers** directly from your mobiGlas. Once you have accepted a contract, from the Accepted tab you will be able to see a detailed list of objectives, and can now also track and untrack contracts to have it sync with your StarMap app, as well as cancel contracts already in progress***.\n_______________________________________\n\n* Users may choose to submit their data to the client at any point, whether the matter has been fully investigated or not. Any complications to arise from this are the solely the responsibility of the user.\n** microTech and mobiGlas do not endorse or guarantee any contracts listed in the Contract Manager and are not responsible for any risks associated with accepting uncertified contracts. \n*** microTech and mobiGlas are not accountable for any and all repercussions related to abandoning contracts.

Journal_General_CrusaderCrimeTutorial_Content=Like many who travel to the Stanton System, you may be wondering how the laws and regulations of the four megacorps compare to the laws in the rest of the UEE. While our status as an independent planet allows us latitude to govern as we see fit, you may be surprised to learn that Crusader Industries adheres to many of the legal guidelines set forth by the Empire in order to provide a safe and secure environment for all.  \n\nHere are few tips to remember while visiting Crusader and its surrounding sectors:\n\n* While the level of crime here is typically no higher than many places in the Empire, visitors should be cautious traveling to more remote areas such as the asteroid belt around the moon Yela since outlaw attacks have been known to occur.\n\n* Even though you are in Crusader Security patrolled space, damaging another individual’s ship or interfering with public landing areas are still considered misdemeanors. Note that repeated offenses will be taken very seriously.   \n\n* Beware of contract offers that involve the disabling of comm arrays. Unsavory individuals often try to lure unsuspecting victims to do this illegal task for them under false pretenses, and many travellers have fallen for this scam. Know that TAMPERING WITH COMM ARRAYS IS AGAINST THE LAW and endangers other people’s lives. Anyone caught disabling a comm array will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n* The moons of Crusader are home to many beautiful sights, and touring them is a must while visiting the area. Just be sure to avoid unmarked outposts, bring plenty of fuel and oxygen, and always locate your closest emergency shelter before setting out an expedition.\n\n* Crusader Security encourages individuals to join us in helping promote a safe environment. Whether you help track down a wanted criminal, assist in patrolling nearby sectors, or respond to ECN alerts to help ships in distress, any contributions you make to the community’s overall security will be noted in your records and may go a long way in making up for any previous minor infractions. By working together we can all make Crusader a better place to visit.

Journal_General_Medical_Content=Whether you haven’t been sleeping well, experienced a traumatic injury, or have , most modern digital assistants like mobiGlas include a wide variety of health monitoring capabilities to make staying healthy simpler than ever.\n\nBy constantly monitoring your key vitals, the software is able to make preliminary diagnoses and alert you about dozens of afflictions you may be experiencing. These alerts, when used properly, can offer guidance and help you know when to make lifestyle adjustments, administer self-treatment options, or seek assistance from a medical professional.  \n\nBelow we have highlighted a few of the more common medical alerts that you may see:\n\nConcussed -\nA mild brain injury that results in temporary loss of cognitive function. Early warning signs of a concussion can include double vision, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.\n\nDehydrated - \nWhen the body does not have enough water to function normally. Symptoms can include thirst, dry mouth, headaches, deteriorating health, exhaustion, and blurred vision.\n\nHemorrhage - \nInternal or external bleeding. It is recommended that you try to stem the loss of blood as soon as possible to minimize deterioration of health.\n\nHyperthermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has risen above safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards fatigue, severe headaches and migraines, difficulty breathing, deteriorating health, and increased thirst. \n\nHypothermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has fallen below safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards severe fatigue, shivering, weakness of the limbs, deteriorating health, increased appetite, light sensitivity, hearing impairment and a risk of paradoxical undressing.\n\nMalnourished - \nWhen the body does not have enough nutrients to function normally. Symptoms can include weakness, deteriorating health, irritability, hearing and vision impairment.   \n\nSevere Injury - \nA general term used to describe when very serious trauma has been inflicted to the body. Often accompanied by vision loss. Requires immediate medical attention.\n\nUnconscious -\nWhen trauma is severe enough, an individual may experience a syncope, lose consciousness and become unable to respond to stimuli. \n\n

Journal_General_Nutrition_Content=We all lead busy lives, and sometimes making good nutrition choices can be a daunting challenge to say the least! \n\nThankfully, by using the NDR and HEI ratings assigned to most commercially available food and drinks, taking better care of yourself has never been easier. Just remember, the *higher* the score, the better the nutrition, and the better you'll feel. \n\nNutritional Density Rating (NDR)\nDevised by Empire Health Services to help people eat healthier, the Nutritional Density Rating (NDR) takes into consideration the food’s concentration of nutrients per 100kcal, the breadth and diversity of nutrients contained, and the nutritional bioavailability. The higher an NDR score, the better a food item is for your overall health. However, it is important to remember that no single food contains all the nutrients a single person needs, so along with eating high-scoring food, the second most important thing an individual can do is consume a wide variety of foods. Here’s to good eating and good health! \n\nHydration Efficacy Index (HEI)\nOriginally created by a team of nutritionists at the University of Jalan to compare the effects of beverage choice on hydration levels during long haul space flights, the Hydration Efficacy Index (HEI) has since been adapted by Empire Health Services as the standard measure by which various drink selections can be compared. By considering such factors as moisture retention, absorbency rates, osmolality, caloric count, and electrolyte levels (specifically sodium and potassium), a beverage can be graded using one standardized index. The higher the score, the more effective the beverage is at keeping the consumer hydrated for longer. Substances like caffeine and alcohol have the potential to decrease the index score by increasing the rate of water loss from the body. Standard filtration system water has a baseline score of 80. \n\nDietary Effects\nIn addition to the baseline scores, many foods and drinks have been additionally labeled with keywords to provide extra information about the potential effects that item will have on your health. Take a look at the list below for some of the most common effects and what they mean.\n\nHypertrophic - Provides additional blood flow and nutrients to key muscle groups to make them perform optimally.\n\nAtrophic - Restricts blood flow, negatively affecting the muscles, making tasks seem harder.\n\nEnergizing - Provides a boost to your energy levels, allowing you to be active for longer.\n\nFatiguing - Has a draining effect, causing lethargy and general sense of exhaustion.\n\nCognitive Boosting - Encourages brain function by allowing additional focus while performing complicated tasks.\n\nCognitive Impairing - Stymies brain activity making it difficult to focus for long durations. \n\nHypometabolic - Digests slowly, making you feel satisfied for longer.\n\nHypermetabolic - Digests quickly, increasing the likelihood you'll be hungry sooner.\n\nHydrating - Helps your body to better absorb water, allowing you to satisfy your thirst for longer.\n\nDehydrating - Causes your body to lose water, making you thirstier.\n\nHealing - Provides vital nutrients to help your body naturally repair itself. \n\nToxic - Contains elements that are detrimental to your health and can cause damage if consumed in large quantities. \n\nImmune Boosting - Helps your body stay healthy when exposed to harmful elements.\n\nImmune Suppressing - Weakens your body's ability to fight off harmful elements.\n\n\n

Journal_General_StarmapQuantumTutorial_Content=Now that your mobiGlas has installed to the new 2.5 network update, you are ready to use the StarMap app to travel the stars in a whole new way. For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \n\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\n\nSafe Travels!\n\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\n\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\n\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \n\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\n\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)

System login indicates that Ward attempted another stress test at 1400 SET on day of accident, but didn’t ever turn the system off. Station systems went critical without the local failsafes and an explosion was inevitable.\n \nReviewing Ward’s personnel file indicated that he’d had addiction issues in the past and had even been suspended previously for negligence. Though supervisor reviews indicated he’d cleaned up since his return, our teams found evidence that he slipped back into bad habits shortly before the accident.\n \nTo perform our due diligence, we’ve exhausted other potential causes, but this one seems to be the most likely.

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

Dr. Colby said that I shouldn’t get too down on myself if I stumbled in my treatment, but I can’t bring myself to believe him. I know I could probably just sleep it off, wake up tomorrow and commit myself to starting fresh, but I don’t know… something just feels wrong about that. Wrong not telling you. Then it feels like it’d be sweeping it under the rug. Like it never happened. I think about all the things I put you, put the kids through, and I just don’t know why I can’t figure this out. \n \nI guess you know where this is going. There was a birthday party tonight and somebody had been saving a bottle of Esquire. It was easy to say yes. I almost didn’t even think about it. What that word would mean. I guess… I think I went back ten years ago, like when we were at school. When having a few drinks didn’t lead to waking up in a medstation or with blood on my clothes. But in that moment, I was the me back then. Just a guy celebrating a birthday with some coworkers…\n \nBut I’m not that guy. And it kills me.\n \nI don’t know who I am anymore. It’s late now. I’m drunk. Drunk and ashamed that I keep letting you down.\n \nI guess all I want is

LingFamily_Danger_001=Also, some of the family has run into trouble doing similar contracts recently. I would be extra careful. You know it's dangerous when cousin Maggi even says it. 
LingFamily_Danger_002=Also, a word of caution. I've got several reports highlighting this particular stretch as potentially dangerous. I don't think anything will happen, but just be ready in case trouble shows up. 
LingFamily_Danger_003=One more thing. I don't want to raise a false alarm, but there's a small chance that this contract may wind up being riskier than usual. Nothing concrete, but I've got a contact in Crusader Security who gave me a heads up. Should be fine, but be careful. 
LingFamily_Danger_004=And I probably don't have to say this, but Crusader's been having some security issues lately. It's not as safe as it once was, especially where you'll be going for this job. Be smart out there and stay safe. 
LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in. 
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one. 
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it. 
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in. 
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job. 
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today. 
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him. 
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today? 
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her. 
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while. 
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job. 
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_001=After that last contract, how many screw ups was that? You know what? I don't want to scold you like you're some kid. I'm just gonna say do better and leave it at that. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_001=Rough time on that last contract, huh? It happens. Important thing is not focus on it too much, and get back out there - 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_002=Hard to say exactly where you went wrong on that last contract, but it wasn't pretty. Let's do better this time, Okay? 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=Got to say, you've really been killing it out there. Even Davi's been impressed and he's been doing this for decades. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=I'm starting to think we got pretty lucky finding you. You've been giving Ling Family Hauling a good name out there with all the recent work you've been doing for us. Speaking of... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=That last contract got away from you or what? Don't worry though. Screwing up every once in a while is what being part of the Ling Family is all about. (Don't tell them I said that.) 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=Tough break on that last job. Can't be perfect all the time, I guess. Unless your my sister Linda. But let's not talk about her right now... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_001=You did good on that last contract. Nice stuff. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_002=Real quick, wanted to mention the last contract you did. Saw that it went well. Good work. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So far, I think as a whole, Ling Family Hauling has been more than fair with you. But this contract is the end. Either you get it right, or we're done working with you. That simple. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_002=Listen, this contract here? This is your last chance. We can't afford to risk any more business on you unless you find a way to turn things around. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_001=Okay. So, I'm gonna tell you straight. If it had been up to me, we would have burned your contact, but dad seems to think you deserve another chance, so here we are... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_002=Here's what's happening. We had a family meeting and decided that maybe you deserve another chance. I hope you make the most of it. That said... 
LingFamily_Timed_001=Unfortunately, we're on a bit of a tight schedule with this one. Need it taken care of ASAP. 
LingFamily_Timed_002=Be sure to keep in mind that this job has a firm deadline. Not much wiggle room. 
LingFamily_Timed_003=Make sure to keep an eye on clock when you're out there. Don't want you missing the deadline. 
LingFamily_Timed_004=Make sure to be mindful of the time while you're working. Our business depends on us being punctual.

Believe it or not, I used to handle all of this myself! Thank heavens for Conni though. She's so good at all this stuff. \n\nAnyway, if I'm reading the invoice correctly, the shipment is at ~mission(Location|Address) and needs to be hauled over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Simple enough. \n\nGood luck out there. Make the Ling family proud!\n\n-Davi Ling\nProprietor \nLing Family Hauling
LingFamily_delivery_desc_intro=Have you always been interested in trying your hand at being a delivery pilot but didn't know where to start? \nAre you sick of being taken advantage of by the large faceless shipping conglomerates? \nDo you want to further your career by gaining on-the-job experience with a top-reviewed family own company? \n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then Ling Family Hauling may be right for you. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nHi,\n\nI'm Davi Ling, proud owner and proprietor of Ling Family Hauling. For the past three years, my family has been making a name for ourselves delivering packages and hauling shipments in the greater Crusader area. But now we need your help. \n\nTo keep up with our growing list of clients, we've been seeking additional pilots to help our family to keep expanding. Right now, we have a shipment waiting at ~mission(Location|Address) to be taken to ~mission(Destination|Address). The perfect opportunity for a new pilot. No prior experience necessary. Whether this is your first time flying a route, or your thousandth, all we ask is that you work hard and try your best. That's the Ling Family way.\n\nSincerely,\nDavi Ling\nProprietor\nLing Family Hauling

MissionManager_KillCommTechs_Description=So, it seems that Aciedo hasn’t really appreciated their comm arrays ‘mysteriously’ shutting off, and in a move I am sure they are going to come to regret, they’ve decided to start hiring technicians to reactivate the uplinks. That’s really not going to work for us. \n\nWe’ve really come to appreciate all the peace and quiet in the area, and want to keep it that way.   \n\nWith your people skills being what they are, I was hoping that maybe you could convince these techs to leave well enough alone. In the permanent sort of way.\n\nAnd for all your trouble, there’ll be a small thank you gift for each Aciedo tech you put an end to.\n\nHave a great day,\n\n-Ruto

NB_IceSculpture_Desc="Mistakes feed the furnace of innovation." - Magnus Tobin, microTech CEO\n\n\nCreated: 2891\nMaterial: Ice\nArtist: Fay Womak\nDescription: A reflection of the city around it, Sublimated evokes the interplay between cold and creativity that are the hallmarks of life in New Babbage. 
NB_IceSculpture_Name=Sublimate
NB_Plant_Desc_001=Created to be able to survive in near no-light conditions. The resulting altered chlorophyll structure gives the plant its dark coloring and unique woven-like texture. It is hoped that this research will help populate worlds with long night cycles.
NB_Plant_Desc_002=Related to the colocasia, this plant features enormous broad leaves that are pliable and water resistant making it an ideal plastic substitute on remote worlds. Additionally, its sprawling root structure is an edible starch when cooked.
NB_Plant_Desc_003=Derived from a Xi'an desert plant, the many ridges along its trunk are ideal for capturing early morning dew in arid climates. The internal storage cells can collect up to a gallon of drinking water a day in the right conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_004=Уникальная фрактальная структура листьев фиолетовой куркумы помогает преобразовать короткие световые волны в частоту, более подходящую для фотосинтеза. Это позволяет растению процветать в системах, где звезды находятся на более поздних этапах своей жизни и не дают идеального света для роста. Его корни также имеют кулинарное и медицинское применение.
NB_Plant_Desc_005=The unique leaves of this palm variant show a huge leap in bio-engineering possibilities thanks to their meticulously designed aerodynamic structure that allows the plant to endure hurricane strength winds.
NB_Plant_Desc_006=This carnivorous plant catches insects with the sticky resin it secretes, allowing it to not only act as an exterminator for unwanted pests, but also survive in severely nitrogen depleted soil.
NB_Plant_Desc_007=The closely woven structure of the haldor lily's provide them with extreme strength and durability. Suitable for planets plagued with torrential storms or swarming insects, this lily is one of the hardier plants ever fabricated.
NB_Plant_Desc_008=With a strong, thin trunk, the sky palm was designed to grow on worlds with thicker atmospheres where it would be able to collect more of the available sunlight at high elevations.
NB_Plant_Desc_009=The thick trunk of this barrel palm tree is able to hold considerable moisture drawn in from the soil offering a possible water conservation solution to settlers living in arid climates.
NB_Plant_Desc_010=The weaver palm was designed to produce a renewable, strong, lightweight, and flexible material that would serve a variety of purposes for settlers of a new world. Low maintenance and hardy, the plant can grow successfully in a variety of conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_011=The designers of this plant wanted to protect it from as many herbivore tactics as possible to ensure that its harvest could reach full maturity undisturbed while leaving it non-toxic. The spikes along the trunk makes climbing difficult, the bark appears diseased and dead, and the leaves contain barbed alkaloids that cause extreme pain with skin contact. DO NOT TOUCH.
NB_Plant_Desc_012=Designed to be grown in wet soil and marshland, the dracaena pura acts as a natural aquifer, cleaning water as it passes through its root system. The height of the plant helps it distribute the pollutants it collects to a lower toxicity level to which it can successfully cope.
NB_Plant_Desc_013=When worlds are first being settled, high winds can be a serious issue until enough plant life can take hold. The grand flabellum with its wide leaf structure and deep root system act as erosion breaks helping to protect more delicate plants and structures.
NB_Plant_Desc_014=The leaves of this plant were crafted by engineers to excrete an oil that serves as a natural insect repellent. It is hoped that by planting it in symbiosis with other more valuable crops that it can serve as a deterrent to harmful pests.
NB_Plant_Desc_015=Created to help alleviate symptoms caused by other airborne allergens, the pollen from the flight-of-fancy's bright flowers is a natural antihistamine and is capable of blocking histamine receptors. As a bonus, its large broad leaves provide ample shade making them ideal to plant near habitat areas.
NB_Plant_Desc_General=Genetically crafted by Rayari Inc., the species of plants on display throughout the city will serve to inspire a whole new generation of terrafomational expansion.

assassin_danger_0001=If even half the rumors about them are true, you're going to want to take them out long before they see you coming. 
assassin_danger_0002=Apparently, this is supposed to be one of the more dangerous hitters in the sector. Do not make the mistake of underestimating them. 
assassin_danger_0003=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Something tells me you might need it to take them down. 
assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast. 
assassin_danger_0005=While you should be careful, cause you never know - my guess is that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is gonna drop easy. Poor sod chooses to fly solo and hardly ever bothers with anything more than a few escorts. 
assassin_danger_0006=As for gearing up for this little job, you shouldn't need anything out of the ordinary. ~mission(TargetName|Last) prefers to fly alone. I mean, for a real special occasion they might travel with a friend or two, but I'd be surprised.  
assassin_danger_0007=Apparently, there's a good chance this scav's not gonna be traveling alone either. Seems that their little multicrew ship hardly ever flies without at least one or two friends along for the trip.  
assassin_danger_0008=Word is that the small multicrew ship ~mission(TargetName|Last) captains is being guarded by a few hired escorts. Can't say for sure if it's true, but good to be careful just in case.  
assassin_danger_0009=Rumor has it that ~mission(TargetName|Last) typically travels with a full escort so be ready to hit hard. Even if you do get lucky and catch them alone, you'll still have their ship to deal with and supposedly they captain a bit of a beast. 
assassin_danger_0010=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Since ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually captains a bigger multicrew ship and springs the extra credits for escort, something tells me you might need the extra firepower. 
assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)
assassin_desc_0001=Looking for someone who doesn't mind getting their hands dirty. Not talking guild work or anything, just someone who's good enough to aim and squeeze.

assassin_desc_0002=Got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nBuddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the 'no-breathe-list'? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? \n\n~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger) \n\nThere isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. A hit's been put out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! \n\nNow instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with the wrong crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec. \n\nA big bounty's been placed on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_easy=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationEasyDescription)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out. \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

blacjac_danger_003=You'll be kicking a bit of a hornet's nest on this one, so be ready for heavy resistance. 
blacjac_danger_004=This perp is a bit of lightweight. Only a few known associates and they typically fly solo crafts. Shouldn't be to hard to catch them. 
blacjac_danger_005=The files on ~mission(TargetName|Last) show that they typically captain a mid-sized multicrew vessel and have been known to employ extra muscle on jobs. Might want to approach with a bit of caution. 
blacjac_danger_006=Be sure that you're ready to face heavy resistance. ~mission(TargetName|Last) is known to captain larger ships and with their connections you can almost guarantee that they're not traveling alone. 
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nWe have a problem over at ~mission(Location). Apparently someone set up PDC Monitors to illegally skim data. \n\nYou are being tasked with locating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroying them. \n\nThere are a few possible complications:\n- These things are designed to operate passively with as low of an EM sig as possible. Finding them might take some effort and thorough scanning. \n- Monitors like these often have automatic security protocols so that if they are attacked, they begin to transmit any stored dated. It's vital you destroy them before the upload can finish.\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nI'm hopeful you'll be able to resolve the issue before any more data is stolen.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nReceived a report that some enterprising criminal has been skimming data from ~mission(Location) using PDC Monitors. \n\nYou are being tasked to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. I suspect it might take a bit of scanning to locate the monitors as they're designed to operate passively. Plus, as soon as you start attacking, their security countermeasures are going to kick in and attempt to upload their data-drives. You'll need to be fast enough to prevent the transfer. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks for taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nI need a merc who can handle locating and destroying PDC monitors that have been illegally skimming data from ~mission(Location). This will take some doing as the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will be operating passively and difficult to find without performing a thorough scan of the area. Plus, you'll have to destroy the monitors before their emergency defense system uploads any more of the data they've stolen.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

We need to clear them out before they have a chance to move the product to another site.\n\nWe need you to secure and destroy any and all narcotics found at the stash using whatever means necessary, so go nuts. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid out for however much of the contraband you personally destroy. Basically, feel free to engage with any lowlifes you come across, but that's not what you're getting paid for - BlacJac's focus for this op is the drugs. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_002=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nAn informant provided us with info on a narcotics stash known as ~mission(UGFDestination). We're organizing a raid to go in and destroy every last bit of contraband being stored there before they have a chance to move it.\n\nYou're tasked with destroying all narcotics found at the site using whatever means necessary... within reason. Basically, do what you can to keep most of the surrounding area intact. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid based on how much of the drug stash you personally clear out. Getting this product off the streets is a huge win for BlacJac, and of course the people of ArcCorp.\n\nGood hunting,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_003=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nThe location of long suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(UGFDestination) has finally been confirmed and we need to raid the site before they have a chance to migrate again. \n\nDestroy any and all drugs found at the site using whatever means you have. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nAnd remember, you'll be reimbursed based on how much of the narcotics you personally eliminate, not how many drug dealers you wipe out. Leadership's focus right now is the drugs, not the pushers because bodies are cheap.

blacjac_hackprevent_desc_002=ATTN: Mercs Experienced in CompSec \n\nThere's been an attempted data breach at ~mission(Location), but they haven't bypassed all the security protocols yet.

I instantly thought of you.\n\nTheir company heard that microTech is developing a cutting edge compression algorithm that could potentially put them out of business, so needless to say, they're very motivated in getting their hands on it and they're willing to pay handsomely. \n\nThe problem is that the program is being developed in one of microTech's off-site research facilities. Traffic into the base is heavily regulated, so you will need to steal an ID to make them think you are one of the workers.

commarray_hack_danger_0003=I'm not expecting trouble, but knowing what security is like in that sector, it's not out of the question. 
commarray_hack_danger_0004=If I'm being honest, these ~mission(Client) had one of their own try to handle the array, and they got taken out. Just don't let the same thing happen to you. Go in prepared, you should come out fine. 
commarray_hack_desc=~mission(Description)
commarray_hack_desc_0001=A couple of ~mission(Client) are working on a big score and they need ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) shut down to make sure they get some privacy. Once it's offline, we'll need you to hang out there to make sure the commlink stays down long enough. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd DON'T forget, you'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the array's controls. \nBring your own if you want, but you can head to ~mission(Location) and grab one there.\nHate for you to head all the way out to the array and not be able to do the damn job.
commarray_hack_desc_0002=~mission(MissionLocation|Address) being online's going to be a problem for some ~mission(Client) working the area. \nShut it down, keep it offline 'til the job's complete, and we'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nOf course, you won't be able to access the array's controls unless you have a CRYPTOKEY with you. \nWe arranged for one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location) if you don't already have one. 
commarray_hack_desc_0003=I don't want to get too specific, but let's just say it would be better for everyone if someone could make sure that ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) was taken out of commission and that it stayed that way for a while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd I shouldn't have to mention this, but for the love of everything, bring a CRYPTOKEY with you. Last thing we need is you showing up unprepared. \nActually, you know what, if you don't already have one, there's a cryptokey at ~mission(Location) that you can use.
commarray_hack_desc_0004=Certain ~mission(Client) have a job in the works, but they can't do it as long as the ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) is still online. Need a systems-grok to disable the comm uplink, and stay onsite long enough to make sure there aren't any issues. ~mission(Danger) Credits on completion. No up-front. \n\n---> REMINDER: Bring a CRYPTOKEY with you to hack the array's controls. Either grab one from ~mission(Location) or bring your own.
commarray_hack_desc_0005=Here's the breakdown -  ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) needs to be taken offline, and ~mission(Client) are looking to hire a hacker to do it and guarantee the uplink's down for as long as needed. ~mission(Danger)That's about all you need to know.\n\n*** P.S. You'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the control panel. We arranged one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location), but if you prefer to use your own, that's fine too.

commarray_repair_danger_0004=Shouldn't have to say this, but use some common sense when you're out there and be ready just in case you run in to some trouble. 
commarray_repair_danger_0005=One thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make sure your security measures are up to snuff before going.

confirmkill_desc_0006=Hope you don't mind corpses, cause I need you to get up close and personal with one. Used to go by the name ~mission(TargetName).

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference)Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Reference)If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Timed)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

crusader_danger_001=Our best intel indicates that you should expect to encounter extreme hostilities while completing this contract. Plan accordingly. 
crusader_danger_002=Having dealt with similar contracts in the past, I would advise bringing along as much firepower as you can muster. Hopefully you won't need it, but it never hurts to be prepared. 
crusader_danger_003=I should warn you that it is very likely that you will face armed resistance. Be ready. 
crusader_danger_004=Having dealt with similar contracts in the past, I'm suspecting that you'll meet only light resistance. A solo pilot at best, a single-seater with maybe an escort or two at worst. 
crusader_danger_005=Our best intel indicates that you should expect to encounter moderate hostile forces on this one. We're looking at possibly a small multicrew craft supported by a light to moderate escort wing. Plan accordingly. 
crusader_danger_006=I should warn you that it is very likely you will face heavy resistance - a large multicrew ship with heavy escort support. Be ready. 
crusader_danger_high_001=We're expecting them to put up significant resistance and do not recommend attempting this contract alone. \n\nCREW NOTE: You are expected to staff your own combat team before embarking on this contract.\n\n
crusader_danger_high_002=Be mindful that these aren't some low tier operators you're going to be facing. They have considerable offensive capabilities at their disposal and a willingness to use them. \n\nCREW NOTE: You will likely need additional manpower if you're going to be successful.\n\n 
crusader_danger_high_003=Know that this won't be an easy assignment. Intel shows that ~mission(Client) have been greatly expanding their arsenal and they will throw just about all of it at you once they get wind of why you're there. \n\nCREW NOTE: I recommend bringing whatever backup you can muster.\n\n  
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0001=Recent intel reports indicate that local criminal elements are operating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location) to case potential targets. \n\nSince monitors like this are designed to be unobtrusive, it makes finding them a real pain. You're going to have to sweep the area to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Once they are located, destroy them.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nBe aware that, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back-up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to finish the job quickly before the transfer's completed.\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0002=A recent routine maintenance around ~mission(Location) revealed the presence of unauthorized surveillance monitors, so you are being contracted to destroy them before any more sensitive information can be gathered. The exact placement of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will needed to be figured out on site, as tracking them is difficult with their low EM signatures. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nThese 'skimmers' are outfitted with security protocols that will trigger data transfers if they are directly attacked. Make sure that you destroy them before the upload can complete. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0003=After seizing some stolen data obtained during a raid, our tech team was able to track the source down to unauthorized surveillance monitors illegally installed around ~mission(Location). \n\nYou will need to find the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) location and destroy them before any more data can be illicitly gathered. Passive 'Skimmers' like these typically are hard to find so be thorough. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed) \n\nOnce engaged, their security protocols will cause them to begin transmitting the contents of their drives. Make sure you stop the upload before it can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Gibbs\nID# 91G66BW0
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0004=I shouldn't be surprised, but it seems like these criminals keep showing more ingenuity every day. Makes you wonder what they could do if they put their mind to something worthwhile, right? \n\nThis time we caught them setting up illegal 'data skimmers' over at ~mission(Location). Who knows what kind of sensitive info they could be accessing? You will need to scan the area to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) which will be tricky because of their low EM and destroy them before their security override kicks in and uploads their datastores. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0005=Bad news. We got reports of illegal 'skimmers' over by ~mission(Location). With the data collected on those things, it could lead to all sorts of trouble, so we need the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) located and destroyed. \n\nEasier said than done, though.\n\nPDC monitors like this are designed to be unobtrusive, so spotting them won't be straightforward. But once you scan the area and locate them, as soon as you start attacking, it will trigger an emergency data transfer. It's important that you take them out before the upload can finish. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K
crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0006=An intel report came in that some outlaws have placed 'data skimmers' around ~mission(Location) hoping to steal sensitive data. We need you to search the area locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. They use a passive form of data collection so they're going to be pretty hard to spot. Make sure that you scan the area carefully to find them. On the bright side though, once you attack one, they'll light up into emergency data transfer mode. Should be real easy to see once they start transmitting. \n\nOf course, it's pretty vital that you destroy them before any data can successfully transfer. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\n\nCONTRACT AUTHORIZED BY:\nLiaison Officer Bautista\nID# 948J030K

destroyprobeillegal_danger_0003=Будь осторожен, иногда они оставляют охрану для защиты этого имущества. Так что возьми ствол.. а лучше пять. 
destroyprobeillegal_danger_0004=Вероятно, ты нарвешься на пачку неприятностей, но это же часть веселья, да? 
destroyprobeillegal_danger_0005=Тем не менее, оборачивайся. Вся охрана возбудится, когда с этими вещами начнёт происходить странное. 
destroyprobeillegal_desc=~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDescription)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0001=~mission(Contractor|Name) сыт по горло арестами в  ~mission(Location|Address). Разворачивайся, тут ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount), которые прослушивают всё, что мы делаем в этой области. Не удивительно, что их продолжают арестовывать. Решите эту проблему для них, и здесь вас ждет приятное  вознаграждение . \n\nТолько знайте, что вам придется просканировать область, так как эти Мониторы PDC - настоящая заноза в стоге сена, и они запрограммированы отсылать данные при получении урона, так что мочите их быстро. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0002=Область вокруг ~mission(Location|Address) стала настоящей головной болью для некоторых моих коллег, так как власти слушают все что мы тут говорим, или делаем.~mission(Contractor|Name) обнаружил ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) неподалеку и ищет кого-то особенного, чтобы утихомирить эти пронырливые PDC Мониторы. Их очень сложно найти, но сканирование области решает только половину проблемы. \n\nКак только ты выстрелил, Бум, они запрограммированы на выключение, и передачу данных обратно в  Cru-Sec Central. Ты должен разорвать их на куски, пока они не успели это сделать.~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0003=Хочешь пострелять по мишеням? Двигайся в ~mission(Location|Address) и размолоти эти назойливые шпионские мониторы в труху. Тут полно ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) и никто не может отыскать эти голимые устройства, поскольку те, во время сбора данных, незаметнее потушенной сигареты. \n\nВ любом случае, эта ситуация напрягает ~mission(Contractor|Name), поэтому они и готовы заплатить кому-то за поиск и уничтожение этой угрозы. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)И последнее, они сопряжены, чтобы сбрасывать свои данные при повреждении, так что уничтожай их быстро.
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0004=Не знаю, дошли ли до тебя слухи, но количество арестов в ~mission(Location|Address) резко возросло. Появляется охрана и сметает всех в кутузку. И не на удачу. Cru-Sec поджидала их. Так что, я провел разведку и обнаружил ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount), наблюдающих за территорией. Многие люди, включая ~mission(Contractor|Name), хотели бы избавиться от этого недоразумения. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nI может гарантировать неплохой куш, и мою глубочайшую признательность. Выследи эти Мониторы PDC где бы они не скрывались, и атакуй их быстро и жестко, пока они не передали собранную информацию. Как только они исчезнут, мы все сможем вернуться к старому доброму криминалу. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0005=Вы были недавно в ~mission(Location|Address)? ~mission(Contractor|Name) сказал мне, что власти раскинули ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount), чтобы шпионить за любым, кто проходит мимо. Я не против небольшой порции законов и порядка, что делает игру игрой, но это зашло слишком далеко. Скажем так, я не единственный кто разделяет эти мысли. ~mission(Contractor|Name)даже платит за восстановление баланса. \n\nThese Мониторы PDC сложно найти, так что вам потребуется просканировать территорию. Плюс к этому, во время нападения. вам необходимо уничтожить их до того, как они переслали всю ту грязь, которую накопали. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Власти считают себя очень умными. Они разместили ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) около ~mission(Location|Address), чтобы качать инфу о ~mission(Contractor|Name). Это понимание не заставило себя долго ждать. Ну что, вы хотите получить оплату, за буквально взрыв их глупого плана? Все что вам нужно, это оказаться тем, кто просканирует область, обнаружит Мониторы PDC, и уберет их.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger) Еще кое-то, что вы должны знать - эти устройства взаимосвязаны для защиты той информации, которую они добывают, так что начав стрельбу, вы должны уничтожить их все, пока они они не сольют все данные обратно на Crusader.

В связи с этим, мы получили добро на привлечение частных лиц для уничтожения этих устройств. По прибытию, вам потребуется осторожно просканировать область, и обнаружить ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Поскольку они работают в пассивном режиме, то сделать это будет непросто.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\n Предупреждаем, что преступники связали свои Мониторы PDC посредством защитных протоколов, чтобы автоматически отсылать данные при атаке, и как только вы откроете огонь, вам надо будет уничтожить их быстро, пока они не закончили передачу.

Согласно внутреннему отчету, ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) обнаружил ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount), которые перехватывают данные. Сканирование области может быть затруднительным в связи с низкой ЭМ сигнатурой, но они должны быть найдены и уничтожены до передачи важной информации.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed) Эти "скиммеры" укомплектованы защитными протоколами.

destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=Мы получили отчеты о том, что криминальные элементы установили ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) недалеко от ~mission(Location|Address), чтобы следить за этой областью. К счастью, нам наконец-то дали добро, чтобы нанять боевых исполнителей для атаки и уничтожения этих систем. И тут ваш выход. \n\n. "Скиммеры" будут работать в своем пассивном режиме сбора данных, что сделает их поиск сложнее, но помните, что после атаки они начнут передавать содержимое своих носителей.~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=Мы ищем опытных боевых пилотов для помощи в уничтожении следящих систем, появившихся в секторе. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Эти незаконные "скиммеры" повлекли за собой смерть сотрудников службы безопасности, а так же гражданских лиц, передавая местному криминалитету данные о перемещении и расположении сил правопорядка . \n\nВам будет поручено просканировать область вокруг ~mission(Location|Address), где по сообщению ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) вы найдете работающие ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Они будут хорошо укрыты, благодаря низкой рабочей мощности. Однако, как только вы их атакуете, они перестанут быть скрытными и начнут передавать данные. Вы должны уничтожить их пока они не закончат выгрузку, иначе мы лишимся очень ценной информации. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location|Address). We are now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures and you may need to preform a thorough scan of the area. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated.

dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking=Dumb-fire missiles need no lock and fire instantly but have no tracking capability.\nHeat-seeking missiles require the target to remain in front of the ship for an amount of time dictated by several factors including your distance from the target and their infra-red emissions. Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.
dfm_ui_AdvMissileLocking_Title=Missile Locking (2/2)
dfm_ui_Afterburner=Afterburner increases the output of your main thrusters at the cost of boost fuel.

dfm_ui_Boosting=To overpower your ship's maneuvering thrusters hold [~action(spaceship_movement|v_boost)]. This will increase your acceleration, but once your ship reaches its top speed the effect of Boost will be negligible.\nBoosting also helps you perform sharp turns by overpowering your maneuvering thrusters to help you achieve a tighter turn.\nYour ship can store a limited amount of the fuel which is used up while Boosting though this does replenish as gases are collected during normal flight.\nIt is important that you bear this in mind and use Boost only in the situations it will make most difference.

dfm_ui_Comstab=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Pad=COMSTAB is a system which manages your ship’s inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can toggle COMSTAB by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_comstab)].

dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain. When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle. In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction. IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error. 
dfm_ui_Control_Frame_Title=Control Frame Title
dfm_ui_CoreDefender=Core Defender
dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Cont=\nCountermeasures are designed to disrupt specific types of missiles lock.\n~icon(Flare|22|22) The flare produces an intense burst of heat in an attempt to lure any pursuing heat-seeking missiles away from your ship. Flares burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The chaff explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].
dfm_ui_Countermeasures_Reminder=To fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].

dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode=The mode above SCM is Cruise.\nThis is a high velocity mode that sacrifices control for speed. Use it to travel more quickly through the local area. It can take some time to reach maximum cruise velocity and even longer to stop with your retro thrusters so be sure to plan your decelerations accordingly.\nCruise is disabled during Basic Training.
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode_Title=Flight Modes (3/4)
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Precision=The mode above Precision is Space Combat Maneuvering (SCM).\nThis is the typical mode used in combat and non-combat flight. Most of your flight time will be spent in this mode. Select this mode any time you wish to have the optimal balance of velocity and drift control.

dfm_ui_FreeLook_Mouse_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Other=To look around your cockpit, push [~action(spaceship_targeting|v_aim_yaw)] in the direction you want to look. After a short time without input, your view will be reset to the center.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad=When using the Game Pad's right stick your view will be locked as the right stick primarily controls the steering of your ship. You can toggle Freelook by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)] to allow the right stick to look around your cockpit.\nBe aware, whilst Freelook is active you will be unable to steer your ship.
dfm_ui_FreeLook_Pad_Reminder=Freelook can be toggled by holding [~action(spaceship_view|v_view_freelook_mode)]. While Freelook is enabled you will not be able to steer your ship.

dfm_ui_G-safe=G-safe is a safety feature which prevents you from performing maneuvers which would put your body through dangerous amounts of g-force by limiting the turn rate of your ship at high velocities.\nCaution, Boosting will override G-safe for the duration.\nWith G-safe disabled you will be able to pull off much tighter turns, but these put more stress on your body and possibly lead to loss of consciousness.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_G-safe_Pad=G-safe is a safety feature which prevents you from performing maneuvers which would put your body through dangerous amounts of g-force by limiting the turn rate of your ship at high velocities.\nCaution, Boosting will override G-safe for the duration.\nWith G-safe disabled you will be able to pull off much tighter turns, but these put more stress on your body and possibly lead to loss of consciousness.\nYou can toggle G-safe by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_gforce_safety)].

dfm_ui_Headshot=В голову
dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.
dfm_ui_ITTS_Title=Intelligent Target Tracking System

dfm_ui_Landing=To toggle your ship's Landing System on and off press [~action(spaceship_movement|v_toggle_landing_system)]. Once engaged, any available landing zones within radar range will display as radar contacts with the nearest automatically becoming focused.\nBe aware that engaging the Landing System disables your combat targeting systems meaning you will lose the ability to lock and fire missiles.
dfm_ui_LandingModes=With the Landing System enabled there are two modes in which you can land.\nYou will begin in Manual Mode.

distraction_desc=~mission(Description)
distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

distraction_wanted_0001=And to be clear, the only way this is going to work is if you can keep a level 5 crimestat on your head the whole time. Anything less and it won't draw the kind of heat we need. 
distraction_wanted_0002=There's a caveat to this whole thing, though. With the amount of attention I want on you, your crimestat needs to stay at a level 5 minimum. It's the only way to guarantee that all eyes are on you. 
distraction_wanted_0003=Of course, an ordinary two-bit criminal won't be enough to get the whole sector engaged. No, you gonna need to rock a level 5 crimestat to create the chaos I'm after. 
distraction_wanted_0004=But the way I figure it, just showing up won't be enough. We need you to maintain a level 5 crimestat the whole time. That way we make sure every do-gooder in the sector will be racing to take you down.

distractionkill_desc=~mission(Contractor|DistractionKillDescription)
distractionkill_desc_0001=I heard that you're big time now with your level 5. Normally, I'd be telling you to keep your head down and till the heat blows over, but it just so happens that I got a better use for you.\n\nI've been working on something big that's ready to go down, but in order to make it happen I need someone to create a distraction that's even bigger. That's where you come in. \n\nThe way I figure it, if you take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy humps, just about every screw in the entire Empire will be focused on dragging your ass down. \n\nCan't be lower sec either. Needs to be Navy to really pull this off. That's fine though, any security gets wind of a level 5 and they'll comm the Navy to come deal with you.\n\nAnd you have to do it fast enough so that the timing works out. As soon as you open fire on the first one, the clock starts.\n\nThink you can handle that?
distractionkill_desc_0002=I'll be honest with you, I usually don't like to deal with your kind of crazy, but a mad dog is exactly what I need right now. \n\nMy crew and I need all the security in the system kept busy for a while and the only way I see that happening is if you bring down enough Navy that they don't have a choice but to stop everything and focus on you. I think about ~mission(KillCount) starmen should do it. \n\nLucky thing is, with your level 5, they should be chasing you anyway. Security stops to scan you and the Navy's gonna come straight to you. Just make sure that once you start shooting that you finish the job. As soon as you engage with the first one, the clock starts and if you don't raise the stakes high enough, me and my crew are gonna be left hanging.\n\nOf course, feel free to kill even more of the bastards if the mood takes you.
distractionkill_desc_0003=Word on the wire is that every flattop with a badge is out there scanning the system for your level 5 wanted ass. What do you say to making some credits off all that hassle?\n\nI can't tell you exactly what's going down, but it's enough for you to know that I need a cataclysmic level distraction. The kind that can only be created by a dangerous and deranged criminal going on a shooting spree and taking out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen. \n\nOnce you start shooting, my crew will move into place, so you'll have to finish the job quick. And Navy only. Popping off some Advos or local security won't cut it. Fortunately, with your crimestat anytime you run into security, Navy shouldn't be far behind.\n\nGet this done for me, and I'll see that you get your fair cut.

ea_ui_mapdesc_Crossroads=Discovered in 2445, the United Nations of Earth was conflicted about what to do with the Nexus system. Since the only jump point at the time was through Cathcart, they tried to use the system as a dedicated military training system, but budget issues forced the government to sell exclusive access to the system to the Hathor Group in a deal that ultimately inspired the sale of Stanton System centuries later. Hathor indiscriminately stripped the system of its resources then abandoned it. Over the decades, outlaws, squatters, and refugees began to move in as the system slipped into obscurity. It wasn’t until Dean Kellar’s infamous run spilled into the system that the UEE realized how dangerous and entrenched these criminals had become and decided to take it back.\n\nThe year is now 2931. The UEE is attempting to restore order by sweeping out the outlaws and squatters who have taken residence in the system. Play as a member of the UEE Advocacy tactical team, led by SAC Darrell Lincoln, or an outlaw in the Supreme gang, led by Leoni “Zombie” Kulkov, in the battle for the Hathor Mining Facility on the UEE's first target to reclaim the system; Nexus III.
ea_ui_mapdesc_TheGoodDoctor=Hatfield & Harding had big plans for planet of Mya in the Leir System when they purchased it from Galor Messer IX in 2743. They entrusted the supervision of the terraforming and settlement to Dr. Marcus Fayel from the University of Persei’s Analytical Research and Quantification campus. Little did they know that Dr. Fayel would not only betray his employees, but he would steal the planet out from under them. On May 3, 2812, all communication with the planet was cut off. Hours later, a single message from Dr. Fayel directed to Hatfield & Harding and the rest of the universe announcing the birth of the Sun’s Eye Fellowship, a new religion based on radical isolationism, and their intent to claim Mya as their own.\n\nFayel’s former employers were furious. Against the wishes of the UEE, they assembled a covert team of mercenaries to secure the planet and eliminate Fayel as well as any followers who got in their way. The operation was a brutal massacre. The Fellowship proved to be more than willing to kill and die for their new leader. The mission’s failure led to the eventual dissolution of Hatfield & Harding and complete control of Mya to Fayel and the Fellowship who became known as the Outsiders.

fine_terminal_informationScreen_Info=\nHow are fines attributed to me?\nMost fines are issued directly by members of law enforcement, but some result from violations detected by ships and mobiGlas and automatically broadcast to the Emergency Communication Network (ECN) system.\n\n\nWhat sort of things can I get a fined for?\nFor a complete list of finable offenses and misdemeanors applicable in your current jurisdiction, please consult your mobiGlas.\n\n\nWhy did I receive a fine for something legal elsewhere?\nCertain jurisdictions have different laws. You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\n\n\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\n\n\nWhat are Escalated Fines?\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\n\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pay my Escalated Fines?\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\n\n\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council. While mistakes are rare, we are trying to improve the system all the time and your feedback is welcome.\n

hdactivist_assassination_danger_001=Don't take this target lightly. There's a reason Hurston's relied on them to do so much dirty work. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_002=You're going after one vicious bastard, so best come prepared. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_003=I'd recommend hitting them hard and fast before they have a chance to comm for backup. 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_004=Watch out for this one. 'Mercy' isn't part of their vocabulary. 
hdactivist_assassination_desc_001=To anyone who knows Hurston's recent history, they know that ~mission(TargetName) is responsible for some truly vicious crimes against the honest men and women who are trying to improve worker conditions on Hurston. Time and time again, they have acted well outside the bounds of UEE law but, of course, Hurston denies that ~mission(TargetName|Last) has anything to do with these crimes and refuses to even investigate them. This miscarriage of justice means that we must take matters into our own hands. \n\nRecently, an insider sympathetic to our cause says ~mission(TargetName|Last) can be found around ~mission(Location). I will happily pass along this information, and a substantial payday, to anyone willing to bring vengeance upon them. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_002=Any chance you've heard of ~mission(TargetName)? Hurston recently promoted this bloodthirsty thug to a special task force that makes dissidents disappear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) has proven to be quite effective and even taken a perverse pleasure in the new position. It's obvious that the universe would be better off if ~mission(TargetName|Last) was taken down.\n\n~mission(Danger)I managed to get a hold of their latest deployment orders. Could be useful when tracking down the target. \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_003=Let's just say the less you know about this one the better. We want you to find and eliminate a Hurston lackey named ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nDetails containing their last known sighting around ~mission(Location) will be provided. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_timed_001=Word spreads fast around here. Don't wait too long on this, or you might lose the element of surprise. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_002=For the sake of the movement, it's vital this gets done soon. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_003=There's chatter that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is planning something big. You've got to stop them before it's too late. 
hdactivist_assassination_timed_004=We need you to move fast on this. Who knows what the target is working on.

hdactivist_assassination_title_003=Retribution
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_001=They aren't expecting you, but don't think for a second this is going to be easy. Those bastards love to fight. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_002=Make sure you have more than enough ammo. There's no way to know how many of 'em will be down there. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_003=Make sure you're armed up and prepared for war. 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_004=I'm not gonna lie, this will get bloody, but that's what we have to do to secure our future. 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston. I need them gone, pronto. Don't care how you handle it, only that it gets done. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\nDo this right and you'll be compensated accordingly.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service. It'll be risky, but I'll also make sure you're paid well for your trouble. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_001=One of the smugglers we work with on occasion, ~mission(TargetName), refuses to complete our arranged delivery unless we triple our agreed-upon payment. As you can imagine, we can't allow their greed to endanger the movement, nor can we afford to pay their unreasonable demands. \n\nInstead, we're hopeful that you'll be able to track them down for us and forcefully retrieve our rightful property. Once you successfully bring the shipment to ~mission(Destination), we will gladly give you the credits we had originally promised ~mission(TargetName|Last). \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_002=Recently, one of our much needed supply runs got hit by an outlaw. Before our hauler died, they managed to confirm the identity of their attacker - ~mission(TargetName).\n\nWe need you to hunt this bastard down and take back what's ours. And of course we'll pay you for delivering the supplies to ~mission(Destination).\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) betrayed us. \n\nAn important shipment we had smuggled in to ~mission(Destination) went missing a few days ago and we were finally able to track it down. One of our operatives, ~mission(TargetName|Last), had stolen it.\n\nWe need that traitor tacked down and the shipment brought back. Do whatever you need to.  \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_004=Hurston Security is taking active action to cut off our supply routes. They're even turning a blind eye to outlaws in the area as long as it's our ships being attacked. We need to respond before our resources are completely cut off. \n\nWe've been able to track down the location of one of these outlaws, ~mission(TargetName). Bring the stolen goods aboard their ship back to ~mission(Destination). I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) will give it up without a fight.\n\nHopefully this'll show Hurston that we will not back down.\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealitem_danger_001=Things could get dangerous. Gear up just in case. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_002=Watch yourself out there. Pretty sure Hurston will do whatever it takes to keep us from getting this thing. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_003=Fair warning, but security might be at the site. If they come after you, do what's necessary to get that crate. 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_004=As always, a gig like this can be dangerous. So plan for the worst, hope for the best, right? 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_005=Be careful. Security could be all over that location. 
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_001=Got information on the location of a certain package that would greatly help our cause. We're looking for someone willing to hit up ~mission(Location), retrieve the item, and deliver it to ~mission(Destination). Interested? \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_002=Want to support a good cause and earn some solid creds? \n\nIf so, then help us get our hands on specific crate that's supposed to be in ~mission(Location). If you find the crate and bring it to ~mission(Destination), I'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_003=There's a growing movement focused on making Hurston a better place and we need some help. We've been tracking a certain item for some time that could help our cause in multiple ways. With Hurston's recent escalation of oppression, we believe now is the time to acquire it for ourselves, but with security forces watching our every move, we need someone else to collect it from ~mission(Location). \n\nIf you bring the crate to ~mission(Destination), we'll pay you a price commensurate with your troubles. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed)  \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_004=Recently, Hurston fabricated charges against a hauler working for us in order to confiscate a very important delivery. Their actions aren't legal, even by Hurston standards, but they don't care and we can't wait attain it through legal channels. That's why I'm looking to pay someone to do it for us.\n\nAn insider who's sympathetic to our cause claims it ended up in ~mission(Location). I'll send you the exact coordinates. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\nOnce you have the crate, bring it to ~mission(Destination) and I'll transfer the creds. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_005=The Lorville customs office claims to have lost a crate that was being sent to us by a prominent supporter outside the system. I've got it on good authority that's a lie. Those Hurston bastards simply seized it to mess with us. I can't let this injustice stand and hope you're willing to help right this wrong.\n\nI just got word that they moved the crate to ~mission(Location). I need someone to find this thing and bring it to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)I'll make sure you're paid well for all your trouble.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_006=I need your help. An old friend was desperate for work, so I threw him a gig hauling a valuable item for us. Turns out he had an active crime stat, and Hurston Security arrested him before he could make the delivery. Now I'm in hot water. That crate needs to get to ~mission(Destination) or I'm screwed.\n\nI pulled a few strings and discovered that the cargo actually ended up in ~mission(Location). I'll pay you if you can retrieve it for me and make the delivery. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum**

Independent Contractor is not required to maintain a personal appearance to participate in an action brought hereunder and can attend by remote conference and/or correspondence, as appropriate under the circumstances.  In the event that applicable law explicitly requires a matter to be addressed to the Independent Arbitrator’s Guild, the Parties stipulate that the conduct of any such conflict resolution process may be conducted by remote in lieu of any relocation or change of venue from the Commercial Territory of the planet of Hurston.\n\n16)  General Terms: All material received from or on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Contract must be returned to a Company operations center in the same condition in which they were received.  Failure to do so may be considered a breach of the Contract and considered stolen or otherwise misappropriated; Company reserves all rights under law and equity to engage measures and actions necessary to retrieve any and all property, physical, material, intellectual, or otherwise.  The parties agree that the Contract as well as any associated terms herein do not constitute a contract of adhesion.  The parties agree that the Contract and any amendments thereto represent the totality of the complete agreement between Company and Independent Contractor without resort to extrinsic evidence.  This Contract is enforceable to the maximum extent permissible by law; if any part of the Contract is deemed unenforceable, that part shall be stricken and the rest of the contract shall continue in full force and effect with any remaining ambiguities interpreted in favor of Company’s intentions as best determined through the resort to extrinsic evidence if necessary.  After completion or termination of the Contract, Sections 5, 8, 9, 11, 14, and 15 remain in effect in perpetuity. Severability and whole agreement.\n\n

item_Desc10mm_pistol_ballistic=Traditional gun powder based ammunition that fires slugs from a shell, detonated by a firing pin. The slug trails down a barrel to help guide its trajectory.
item_Desc10mm_rifle_laser=The Plasma Coil - Field Fusion tangles 2 streams of plasma energy into a dense coil before unraveling it, allowing it to shoot far distances with intense energy. Unfortunately this process creates a lot of sound for the user, even though many muffle mechanics are usually built within the chamber of weapons that use this type of plasma energy.
item_Desc12g_electric=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.
item_Desc20mm_Tungsten=<-=MISSING=->
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic_fragment=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc2ghz_microwave_energy=Uranium Core ammunition stabilizes uranium for portable weapon usage in small doses. Each 'magazine' contains a set charge of power with the uranium and can be safely disposed of/stored after use. When used, it controls an intense amount of radioactive energy from whatever method the radiation is disposed. The condensed radiation is powerful enough to get through most armor types except Heavy/TITAN armor.
item_Desc300i-C_LoadoutKit=Increase your killer instinct with the 300i-C package. Two S3 Klaus & Werner laser repeaters replace the standard Behring ballistic repeaters, while upgrades to the power plant (Civilian, Grade B), shield (Industrial, Grade B), and cooler (Industrial, Grade B) push performance further.  \n 
item_Desc300i-G_LoadoutKit=Stay frosty with the 300i-G package. Gimbals give the 300i-G a wider range of motion for its three S2 Klaus & Werner laser repeaters to make aiming even easier. \n 
item_Desc300i-T_LoadoutKit=Extend your adventure with the 300i-T package that features an upgraded power plant (Civilian, Grade B), cooler (Competition, Grade B), and quantum drive (Civilian, Grade B) to provide the extra performance needed to send you faster and further into the unknown. Dual S3 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters can subdue aggressors long enough for an swift escape. \n        
item_Desc300i_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc315p-GT_LoadoutKit=The 315p-GT package helps turn any outing into an adventure thanks to its upgraded cooler (Stealth, Grade B) and quantum drive (Industrial, Grade B). The complement of two gimbaled S2 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters ensure that you can peacefully resolve almost any altercation, but if aggression is your only option, the GT replaces the standard Firestorm Kinetics Tempest missiles with Talon Dominators. \n   
item_Desc315p-XC_LoadoutKit=Built to make an entrance and an impact, the 315p-XC package pairs two S3 Gallenson Tactical Systems ballistic gatling guns with the standard tractor beam. An improved power plant (Stealth, Grade B), shield (Stealth, Grade B), cooler (Stealth, Grade B), and quantum drive (Military, Grade B) provide the power and protection needed to survive and thrive in a skirmish.\n  
item_Desc325a-CC_LoadoutKit=Get up close and personal with the 325a-CC.

The XC also overhauls the component suite to contain a power plant (Military, Grade B), shield (Military, Grade B), cooler (Military, Grade B), and quantum drive (Civilian, Grade C).

item_Desc325a_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc350r-SP_LoadoutKit=Power and performance purr through every inch of the 350r-SP package. It features across the board upgrades to the components, with the power plant, shield, cooler, and quantum drive all rated as Competition class, Grade B.

Plus, two Associated Science & Development S3 distortion repeaters provide a non-lethal alternative to the standard Behring laser cannon.
item_Desc350r_HAPR_VP_ESI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion Twin HM4.3 is notable for the fact that it utilizes 2 high-performance TR3 thrusters in a small package. An unusual application, the original design was a joint collaboration between Hammer Propulsion and the Origin Jumpworks racing team. With the additional thrust provided by a second thruster the Twin HM4.3 is ideal for applications where speed is the goal. Speed comes at a cost, however; this configuration has a thirst for fuel that rivals much larger single thruster systems, and with all of its available space being taken up by the thruster internals not much space is left for durability reinforcement. This makes the HM4.3 ideal for most racing pilots, but less suitable for combat-oriented missions.
item_Desc5mm_rifle_ballistic=The size of a traditional 5.56mm x 45mm but built for Gauss mechanics, providing very high accuracy and extremely fast projectile speeds. The 5.56mm slug is made out of a dense tungsten and lightweight carbon mixture, to allow maximum penetration in this Armor Penetration form.
item_Desc6mm_pistol_laser=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.

Once it has safely returned to Mars, the blend is aged for several more years to ensure it has the distinct smooth and mellow profile Radegast is known for. The result is a 40-year-old dram that embraces the adventurous flavor profiles of Angeli with the traditional personality of a Martian whiskey; a drink worthy of coming home for.

For a short while, before the Safety Commission stepped in, he would race naked, claiming clothes were an unnecessary weight. Another such innovation that was considerably more successful (and modest) was his insistence that the shields being used on his racer were too powerful. He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.

mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_001=A tremendous opportunity seems to have landed... well crashed in our favor. A Hurston satellite has quite ungracefully plummeted to the surface. Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

mg_miles_assassin_danger_0003=Получше вооружись перед этом делом. ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) не захочет уйти по тихому. 
mg_miles_assassin_danger_0004=Основываясь на репутации цели я бы ожидал что эта операция наверняка перерастет в потасовку. 
mg_miles_assassin_danger_0005=Слышал это имя ранее. Я бы вооружился получше и ударил пока они не поняли что происходит. 
mg_miles_assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)
mg_miles_assassin_desc_0001=Вот немного деталей о той небольшой услуги о которой мы разговаривали. Необходимо найти ~mission(TargetName), найти цель можно у ~mission(location). ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)
mg_miles_assassin_desc_0002=Имя: ~mission(TargetName)\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) Я так же высылаю ~mission(location) в данном сообщении. Убедись что все будет сделано правильно. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)
mg_miles_assassin_desc_0003=Имя цели - ~mission(TargetName). Я прикрепляю ~mission(location) к сообщению. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Что бы ты не планировал делать - сделай всё как нужно.

mg_miles_assassin_desc_0005=Вот вся информация которая у меня есть. Имя цели:~mission(TargetName). Не знаю что он такого наделал но кто то явно вышел из себя.

mg_miles_assassin_sync_danger_high=Кстати, эти двое бывалые налетчики - хорошо обученные и вооруженные. Приготовься к серьезному сопротивлению когда попытаешься их убрать.
mg_miles_assassin_sync_danger_low=Если загонишь их в угол то проблем быть не должно. Эти двое в основном работают по одиночке.
mg_miles_assassin_sync_danger_medium=Кстати, возможно у этих двоих будет дополнительный эскорт.
mg_miles_assassin_sync_desc_001=Я хочу чтобы вы убрали для меня две цели: ~mission(TargetName) и ~mission(TargetName2). \n\nПроблема в следующем - как только один поймет что на второго напали то сразу заляжет на дно. Мы не можем рисковать упустить кого то из них. \n\nНужно будет скоординировать удар, я хочу чтобы вы нанесли его по обеим целям в одно и то же время. \n\nТак как ты не можешь быть в двух местах одновременно то найди кого то кому можешь доверять для помощи с этим делом.\n\n~Mission(Danger)
mg_miles_assassin_sync_desc_002=Была назначена награда за головы ~mission(TargetName) и ~mission(TargetName2). Вообще иметь сразу две цели не так уж странно, но клиент хочет этим послать крайне своеобразный сигнал так что вам необходимо атаковать цели в одно и то же время. Дополнительная оплата должна покрыть вопросы связанные с решением этой проблемы. \n\nИ так как эта парочка не путешествует вместе то очевидна необходимость в дополнительной помощи, помощи от кого то кому вы доверяете.\n\n~Mission(Danger)
mg_miles_assassin_sync_desc_003=Интересный контракт лёг ко мне на стол. Контракт подразумевает две цели о которых нужно позаботиться синхронно.\n\nДумаю клиент волнуется что если они не ликвидированы одновременно то один из них сможет рассориться во тьме и позже попытаться отомстить. Они известны как ~mission(TargetName) и ~mission(TargetName2).\n\nСоберите группу, разделяйте и покоряйте.\n\n~Mission(Danger)

mg_miles_blackboxillegal_desc_0002=Одни мои давние клиенты имеют,  как сказали бы, "определенные вкусы" которые не всегда хорошо себя ощущают в границах законного. К несчастью для них они так же слабовольны и иногда совершают ошибки. Я не назову имен, но, как бы сказать, ты вероятно о них слышал. Как бы то ни было у них случился один из этих небольших "инцидентов", они готовы заплатить чтобы на месте не осталось ничего лишнего. Конкретно данный инцидент случился на борту ~mission(ship) так что я хочу чтобы ты отправился к ~mission(location) и нашел ~mission(item). Мой контакт в ~mission(destination) может обо всём позаботиться - так что просто передайте ему ящик и уходите. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_blackboxillegal_desc_0003=Вот некоторые подробности по операции о которой я упоминал. Мне нужно чтобы вы достали мне ~mission(item) из ~mission(ship) который потерпел катастрофу. В этот раз я хотел бы чтобы вы доставили груз в ~mission(destination) вместо обычного места. ~mission(trouble)Я перешлю тебе ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)
mg_miles_blackboxillegal_desc_0004=Всё довольно просто. Я пришлю тебе данные об одном месте где потерпел крушение ~mission(ship). Вы отправитесь к ~mission(location) и заберете там ~mission(item). ~mission(trouble)Как только закончите то доставьте посылку одному из моих людей в ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)
mg_miles_blackboxillegal_desc_0005=Это скорее оплачиваемая услуга чем официальный заказ. Я хочу чтобы ~mission(item) из ~mission(ship) был найдет и убран со сцены. Деталей тебе лучше не знать, просто учти что некоторые, действительно могущественные люди хотят чтобы об этом позаботились тихо и без шума. Как только обнаружишь цель - доставь в ~mission(destination) и спокойно уходи. ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)

mg_miles_blackboxillegal_rush_0002=Мне нужно чтобы это было сделано прямо сейчас, так что оставь то что ты там планируешь и выполни этот заказ. 
mg_miles_blackboxillegal_rush_0003=Сделай это быстро, хорошо? Чем быстрее всё кончится тем быстрее все получат свои деньги.

mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0001=Дело такое. ~mission(ship) вылетел и нарвался на проблемы. Клиенты хотят чтобы кто то отправился к ~mission(location) и достал им ~mission(item). Как только достанешь что требуется, забирай и доставь в ~mission(destination) ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush) Просто, не так ли?
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0002=В общем если кратко - с ~mission(ship) во время перелета приключилось несчастье и печальный конец. Клиент хочет чтобы ~mission(item) извлекли из ~mission(location) и отвезли в ~mission(destination). Меньше знаешь - крепче спишь. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0003=Вот космопрогулка о которой я хотел бы тебе рассказать. Мне нужно чтобы ты вытащил ~mission(item) из ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)Как закончишь - доставь в ~mission(destination). Оплата по доставке. ~mission(rush)
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0004=Это нехитрая подработка по вывозу определенного груза. Я хочу чтобы ты перевез ~mission(item) из ~mission(location) в ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)Получишь свою долю как всё будет сделано. ~mission(trouble)
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0005=Так вот есть один парень, мы проворачиваем кое какие дела совместно, и он попал в передрягу. Один из его ~mission(ship) оказался уничтожен в пути. А он всё ещё ждет доставку ~mission(item), перевозимый там, в ~mission(destination), и он готов заплатить чтобы посылка туда добралась. На этом месте в игру вступаешь ты. Направляйся в ~mission(location), забери посылку и закончи доставку. ~mission(trouble)Получишь деньги как только доставишь груз в целости. ~mission(rush)
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0006=Мимо меня прошел слушок что ~mission(ship) получил по взрослому пока перевозил некий интересный груз. Мне подумалось что не повредит туда отправиться и утянуть его, верно? Направляйся к ~mission(location) и отвези ~mission(item) в ~mission(destination). Я позабочусь чтобы ты не был обижен за этот напряг. ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_desc_0007=Тот ~mission(ship), за которым я следил, был недавно взорван. В то время как это всецело печальная ситуация для всех заинтересованных лиц, дело есть дело и этот корабль по случаю перевозить кое что интересное,  что должно попасть по месту назначения. Вам нужно найти ~mission(item) в ~mission(location) и доставить в ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble) \n\nСделай это и ты не только станешь мне хорошим другом но и заработаешь неплохие деньги.

mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_troub_0003=Верю ты позаботишься и о всех кто попытается вмешаться. 
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_troub_0004=Думаю мне не нужно говорить что все препятствия, в случае их появления, нужно будет убрать. 
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_troub_0005=Встретишь кого то готового подраться - разберись с ними. 
mg_miles_spacecollect_steal_troub_0006=Если кто сунется в наши дела - пореши их.

mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_001=Иногда винтикам срывает резьбу. Один из офицеров BlackJac, который должен был присматривать за нашими интересами, похоже кормится с двух рук и работает на другую бригаду. Так не пойдет. \n\nВыследите этого Офицера ~mission(TargetName) и позаботьтесь о нем. Там наверняка будут его дружки из BlackJac так что будет жарко - будьте готовы.\n\n-Twitch \n
mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_002=Офицер из BlackJac по имени ~mission(TargetName) похоже возомнил себя каким то великим героем и собирается остановить все наши дела раз и на всегда. \n\nПроблема в том что этот сияющий рыцарь ещё и не глуп, а так же мотивирован достаточно чтобы действительно быть проблемой. \n\nНам нужно чтобы его дела намертво встали пока он не нарыли чего то действительно опасного. И мне не важно как много оперативников BlackJac вам придется положить рядом. \n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_003=~mission(TargetName), старый офицер BlackJac, на второй зарплате из наших рук, внезапно решил отрастить чувство справедливости и этот новый стиль ему совсем не идет. \n\nНам нужно чтобы ~mission(TargetName|Last) замолчал навсегда до того как получит шанс что то разболтать. \n\nПозаботьтесь об этой проблеме а так же о любых оперативниках BlackJac которые решат заглянуть на вечеринку.\n\n-Twitch\n\n
mg_pacheco_assassin_law_desc_004=Пойми меня правильно, я люблю кредиты так же как любой другой - но лояльность всё же ценится больше денег. \n\nОфицер ~mission(TargetName) вдруг решил что получает от нас мало и угрожает сдать своим боссам из BlackJac информацию о наших деловых вопросах. \n\nПоэтому вы отправитесь туда и положите конец жадности этого подонка раз и навсегда. \n\nНе нужно удивляться его он побежит за помощью к своим дружкам из BlackJac как только зазвучат выстрелы.

mg_pacheco_basesweep_law_desc_002=У меня в работе кое что по настоящему большое, но чтобы всё провернуть нужно убедиться что у BlackJac не будет достаточно сил и они будут весьма вовремя отвлечены. \n\nЕсть идея убить двух птичек одним выстрелом - устройте набег на  ~mission(Location) и убейте всех офицеров каких найдете. \n\nЭто должно привлечь достаточно внимания. \n\n-Twitch\n

mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0001=До меня дошло словечко что силы безопасности собираются накрыть один тайник, известный как ~mission(UGFDestination), который используют какие то дельцы для хранения целого клада из наркоты. Среди их товаров затесался некий пакет с Maze. Похоже они хотят подняться в этом мире. \n\nУличная цена на Maze просто зашкаливает... что странно. Maze выглядит как какие то древесные опилки как по мне. В любом случае птичка напела что кто то навел BlackJac на это небольшое предприятие и, скажем просто, это открывает перед нами уникальную возможность. Я знаю когда должен начаться рейд так что я хочу чтобы вы напали на это место до того как он начнется и привезли обратно пакет с Maze. \n\nВам будет необходим корабль в который влезет минимум 1 ящик, но если хотите взять что то побольше то пожалуйста. Всё остальное в хранилище тоже можете забрать если вас не смущает вся эта возня с переноской. Главное - убедитесь в том что доставите Maze в ~mission(Destination) и мы полностью в расчёте. Понятно? \n\nЕсли столкнетесь с любым сопротивлением то верю вы с этим разберетесь - главное помните про то что Maze тут главное. \n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0002=Какое кто из наших конкурентов в ~mission(UGFDestination) вот вот нарвется на целую кучу настоящего невезения. BlackJac уловили след ведущий к их укромному тайнику и собираются устроить облаву. \n\nМне удалось узнать когда именно они собираются нападать на тайник и я хочу чтобы вы были там первыми. Мне кажется что банда заправляющая этим место не отнесется с большим энтузиазмом к тому что вы собираетесь их ограбить - так что если нарветесь на проблемы то решите их как надо. \n\nЯ хочу чтобы вы ворвались туда и забрали их пакет с Maze до того как силы безопасности там всё уничтожат. Кароче, там целая гора наркоты но, что удачно для тебя, Maze выглядит как древесная стружка и у вас не будет проблем распознать нужный пакет. Если у тебя есть корабль с достаточно большим трюмом то вы можете прибрать любые другие наркотики в свою пользу. \n\nГлавное заберите по крайней мере 1 упаковку Maze, за которую мы вам и платим, и доставьте в ~mission(Destination).\n\n-Twitch\n
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0003=Есть тут один небольшой райский уголок под названием ~mission(UGFDestination) в котором какая то местная шпана устроила целый склад с наркотой. Слышали о таком? \n\nНе важно, пару часов назад один источник напел нам что через это место будет проходить пакет с Maze. Не знаю приходилось ли тебе встречаться с Maze до этого но штука выглядит на вид как кусочки древесной коры. \n\nМои боссы хотят получить этот пакет, но так же, по некоторым причинам, не хотели бы вступать с этой группой в открытую войну. Вероятно за ними стоит кто то важный. Так или иначе но я намекнула BlackJac об этом месте и они готовятся провести облаву. \n\nЯ хочу чтобы отправились туда и захватили Maze до того как весь тайник сгорит в огне. Не удивлюсь если в тайнике будет охрана - так что раздобудь оружие. Если хотите поживиться тем что там найдете то это ваши проблемы найти достаточно большой корабль для вывоза добра. Но ваш минимум это иметь корабль для перевозки одного пакета с Maze, который принадлежит нам, прямо в к ~mission(Destination). \n\nТак же, не особо волнуйтесь о зачистке ворья которое вы там можете найти. Разумеется если они встанут у вас на пути. Благодаря действиям BlackJac, любые трупы которые там останутся лежать будут записаны на их счёт. \n\n-Twitch\n

mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0001=And from what I've been hearing, this scav's dangerous. If you wanna stay healthy, be smart about how you handle this one. 
mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0002=Apparently, this scav's totalled up a hefty body count over the years. Don't underestimate them. 
mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0003=And so you know, you won't be the first person who's gone after ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst). People think that they're a little bulletproof. Might take a few shots to keep 'em down. 
mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0004=Bit of warning, my hunch says ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s gonna give you a good fight. See that you put up a better one. 
mg_ruto_assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0001=The ~mission(Client) got a serious problem with ~mission(TargetName) and guess what? You're gonna be their problem solver. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) And feel free to be as noisy as you like on this one. It'll help send a message to anyone else who's thinking about making trouble.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0002=I'm helping ~mission(Client) to arrange a funeral for ~mission(TargetName). I'm in charge of the entertainment but the only thing we're missing now is a corpse. Try taking a look at ~mission(Location) and see if you can scare one up. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0003=~mission(TargetName) is a ghost. Problem is, no one's told them they're dead yet. The ~mission(Client) wanted you to deliver the message. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)I hear they're still haunting ~mission(Location) so you might want to start looking there first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0004=A piece of trash that goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName) just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Need you to put them down. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Last piece of advice - don't try to talk to them first or anything weird. Just do the job.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0005=Long story short, ~mission(TargetName) screwed over the ~mission(Client) and as it turns out, it's going to be the last thing they ever do. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) A friend of the ~mission(Client) spotted them near ~mission(Location) so I'd suggest starting there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) You find them, you put them down. Make it messy, make it clean. They didn't specify and I don't care. Just see that it's done right.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0006=The ~mission(Client) put out a hit on some local that's been stirring up trouble and you're going to execute it. Target's name is ~mission(TargetName) and though I don't have precise lock on their location, I'll send ~mission(Location) and you can go from there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger)

mg_ruto_assassin_sync_danger_low=And despite the fact they made a mess big enough to get themselves killed, my understanding is that they are relative lightweights. Don't expect you to meet too much resistance.
mg_ruto_assassin_sync_danger_medium=And I figure I should mention that they might be traveling with backup. Nothing you can't handle, but things might get a little messy. 
mg_ruto_assassin_sync_desc_001=Guess what ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) have in common? \n\nYou're gonna kill 'em both!\n\nDifficult part is that I need you to kill them at the same time so that one doesn't have a chance to escape, or worse, kill the person trying to kill them. \n\nSo put together a team to track one target while you handle the other. Divide and conquer!\n\n~Mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_assassin_sync_desc_002=I really hope that you're not buddies with ~mission(TargetName) or ~mission(TargetName2) because I need you to ghost the pair of them... at the same time...\n\nOf course they wouldn't make this easy on us and travel in the same ship or something obvious like that. No. You're going to have to put together a crew so that you can down both targets simultanously. \n\nAs soon as one of them is dead, be ready to drop the other one too. Can't risk either of them getting away.\n\n~Mission(Danger)\n
mg_ruto_assassin_sync_desc_003=Call me a romantic, but there's something kind of nice about not having to die alone, right? \n\nNot ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) are going to know they had company. Not if you do this contract right and kill them both at the same time.\n\nA double hit can sound complicated, but if you hire some additional guns it shouldn't be all that hard to do two hits simultaneously.\n\n~Mission(Danger)

mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_danger_0003=Prep for a fight. Word around the campfire is that some heavy hitters are circling this one.

mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0001=Seems the ~mission(client) are trying to erase how a ~mission(ship) got itself vented. I'll send you the location of ~mission(location), so go, pull the ~mission(item) and drop it off with a contact of mine at ~mission(destination). They'll take care of the rest. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0002=~mission(rush)You gotta head out to the wreck of a ~mission(ship), pull a ~mission(item), and run it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(client) will transfer your money when they get confirmation it's done.
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0003=Not sure if you heard, but a ~mission(ship) got wasted recently in sys. Now, I'm not going to say who, but let's just that the person or persons responsible need someone to steal the ~mission(item) before it falls into the law's hands. I'll hook you up with the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)Once you get the ~mission(item), you run it over to ~mission(destination) where they'll scrub it. That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0004=Got a client who came asking about a ~mission(ship) that went down recently. They're very interested in someone retrieving the ~mission(item) and taking it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)Of course, they're willing to pay for this. ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_desc_0005=Got a straight boost job here. You go out to the ~mission(ship)'s wreck and pull the ~mission(item). Anything else you wanna grab is yours for the taking. ~mission(rush)I got all the details about ~mission(location), but once you get it, run it to my people over at ~mission(destination) and get paid. Should be squeezy. ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_blackboxillegal_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location).

mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0003=Oh, one more thing. You might have to kill some people to pull this off. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0004=Hope you're up for a scrap. This job's set to get nasty. 
mg_ruto_commhack_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0001=Some ~mission(gang) are looking to get CommArray ~mission(CommArray) taken offline. ~mission(rush)Don't care how it's done. Just needs to get done. Sort it out for them and you'll get a nice bonus. ~mission(threat) ~mission(time)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0002=Look, no one likes being monitored while they work, right? So all we're going to do is take down Array ~mission(CommArray) for a little while while some people do some work. ~mission(rush)We don't need to get into who's doing what or any of the other details, the important thing is that once it's offline, some credits are going to find their way into your account courtesy of some ~mission(gang). ~mission(Time)Sounds good, right? ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0003=I just got paid to manufacture a blackout. Which means that you can get paid for executing one. It's fairly simple, head over to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. ~mission(time)~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0004=I was contacted by some ~mission(gang) to provide a little privacy. Guess they have a job or something going down. Anyway, that's not for you. You are going to bring down CommArray ~mission(CommArray). ~mission(time)~mission(rush)Take it down and I'll pay you out. ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0005=So it seems somebody wants to make an area less secure. Shocking, right? As a struggling businessman in these tough economic times, I am uncomfortable with such a request, but I feel obligated to my clients. Customer service is very important to me. Anyway, you'll need to gain entry to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_01=Go to CommArray ~mission(CommArray).

mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0002=Gonna need this handled on the quick side too, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0003=Don't mess around. This has got to get done now. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0004=You need to move quick on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0001=One more thing though, you're gonna need to make sure it stays off for a while. The pros need time to work, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0002=When it's done, I'm gonna need you to babysit the array. Make sure no do-gooders come and switch it back on. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0003=Here's the deal. Once the array's down, make sure it stays down. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0004=You'll need to stick around once the hack's done. I need that blackout sustained for a bit.

mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0001=You might run into a little trouble out there. I mean, that's fitting right? You are going out to find a body. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0002=And arm up. You're heading to a crime scene, you know. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0003=Keep an eye on your scans. There might be some unfriendly sorts out there. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0004=This might go without saying, you are hunting down a corpse after all, but there might be a bit of violence out on this job. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TokenName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TokenName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0003=I don't really know how long bodies stick around for, so I'd recommend getting a move on.

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0002=I'm not anticipating this to be a smooth run though, so I'd make sure your guns are working. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0003=I'm not gonna lie. This one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0004=Just gonna say, the last couple people I've sent on these runs have gotten tuned up, so stay sharpish. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0005=Might wanna get ready for a fight too. You never know. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_02=Collect the ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_distraction_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.

mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_001=To make sure that they're paying attention, you're gonna have to get yourself to crimestat 5 and stay there. Only way to guarantee that every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_002=Here's the real fun part. In order to pull this off, I need you to get a level 5 crimestat. Hack a comm array, kill a bunch of people. I don't really care how. Just get to level 5 and stay there. That way there's no chance they're gonna be able to ignore a dangerous criminal such as yourself. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_003=Now, the reason I wanted you for this job specifically is cause of your crimestat level. Only a level 5 like yourself is a big enough threat to pull the kind of heat I'm talking about. Just do me a favor and make sure you stay at a 5 till this is all over. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_004=Plus, with your crimestat at a 5, you're the ideal candidate to pull this job off. Everyone within the system will be beating each other senseless to get a crack at taking you down. It's perfect. As long as you stay a level 5 that is. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_005=In order for this to work, you're gonna need to have a crimestat 5. That's the only way to make sure every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. Now, as it happens, I'm plugged directly into the system's ECN, so once you take the gig, I'll make you notorious.
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_006=The catch is you gotta instantly become the system's most wanted to get the kinda heat we want all focused on you. Fortunately, I got myself a backdoor into your criminal files to make that happen. All you gotta do is say yes and your crimestat goes through the roof, then you just focus on raising some hell out there.

mg_ruto_havejob_title_0008=got something for you
mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(Client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the remains disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(Location01). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the boxes and dispose of them. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(Client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(Location01) and need the packaged up remains disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. \n\nThere's remains of a body down at ~mission(Location01). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that the boxes need to get gone. Take them off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_02=Collect the body.

mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0001=Need to take care of this quick though. Sorry. Hate to rush, but you know, clients are paying.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0002=Oh, I'll need you to sort this out on the quicker side.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0003=One more thing, you'll need to hurry. Clients want this handled now.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0004=Yeah, probably should mention that I need this taken care of immediately, so off you go.

mg_ruto_invite_desc_0001=You handled yourself pretty well. I suppose it's time we meet up and make this official. Sound good? I'm working out of this old tech shop on Grim HEX called Technotic. Just come on in and find me in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, swing by when you can.
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.

mg_ruto_invite_oldman_003=Word of warning, the guy I have guarding the counter is violent. Real violent. If you see him wearing green, run. That's his trigger color.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0002=A lot of people are waiting on them to be up and running again, so basically, hurry the hell up with this. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0003=A lot of credits run through the place which makes this repair pretty damn urgent. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0004=Some other jobs I got cooking are waiting on this being taken care of and I don't like being kept waiting. Faster you get this done the better. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0005=Not to rush you or anything, but this needs to get taken care of fast. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_01=Acquire replacement battery.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a couple of boxes of remains where they shouldn't be. ~mission(Client) need a cleaner to cart them off-world. ~mission(Timed)And don't tell me what you do with them. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to "clear out the desk," so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(Timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em. Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(Client). ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(Client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(Client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address). 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_02=Collect all boxes containing remains and remove them from the site.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0002=The ~mission(Client) are a little on edge about the remains just sitting out there. I've told them there's nothing to worry about, but let's go ahead and take care of this as fast as possible. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0003=We need to hurry up and take care of this before before someone starts poking around. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Remain are not going anywhere, but the ~mission(Client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0001=This job comes with a timetable, so I'm gonna need you to move quick on this.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0004=Be ready for a scrap. I'm not expecting this one to go smoothly. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0001=Make sure you bring some guns. There's a high potentiality that this one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0002=There's a good chance you might need to kill some people on this one. I trust you don't have a problem with that. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0003=And keep your eyes open. Word is there are predators circling, if you get my meaning. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0004=You don't mind killing people right? I'm not promising anything, but you might want to make sure you got some guns. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0005=Guy I know said that this job might've been shopped around before it landed with me, so there might be some unfriendly competition out there. Handle them.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0003=Hurry up on this one. There are people waiting.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address).

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_001=And I don't know if they've been doing some special training, or if they changed what they've been feeding the bastards, but some of these security pilots aren't half bad at fighting. Make sure you go in ready. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_002=Now, if this was a one on one, I'd put my credits on you hands down, but since these sec-jobs tend to travel in packs, clearing them out may end up being a pretty tough fight. Not trying to scare you off, just think you should know what you're in for. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_003=Be good to teach these corporate guns that standing up to the ~mission(client) doesn't pay. However hard they fight - and trust me, they're gonna fight - you fight back even harder. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_004=Of course, as much as we make fun of these security hacks, don't underestimate them. Any idiot with a gun can kill you if you get sloppy. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0002=Anyone messes with you, you drop them, yeah? 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0003=Another thing, this'll take you in some rough parts of space. I'd recommend guns. Lots of guns. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0005=One of my people told me the ~mission(client) might've shopped this job around, so you may run into some trouble. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0001=A ~mission(ship) got punched out while on the drift. ~mission(client) are paying for someone to go out and pull a ~mission(item) from the wreck. ~mission(trouble)Once you get it, they want it dropped over at ~mission(destination). Sort it and you get paid. I'll send all the details about ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck. I don't know if they killed the ~mission(ship) and I don't really care. Once you got the ~mission(item), just take it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination). I'll send you the details on ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0006=I'm gonna include the exact job request from the ~mission(client) in its entirety just so you can see what I have to deal with:\n\nhy Ruta, my offaz an i went an downed a ~mission(ship) off in the black. bozz wanna boxes from it but didnt tell us. we three bottlz inna night and needin someone to go grab it. i sendin creds for it. \n\nI just don't know how some of these idiots stay alive as long as they do, much less fly a spaceship.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0001=Here's the deal, got a tip from ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) that some skag named ~mission(TargetName) got real ambitious and snagged a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some suckers. That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0002=How do you feel about thieving from thieves? Shouldn't matter, right?

Track down a ship owned by ~mission(TargetName), take it out and retrieve a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreckage. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, all you gotta do is drop off the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) over at ~mission(destination). Pay's coming down from ~mission(client), so make sure you deliver.
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0005=~mission(client) are paying for someone to knock over ~mission(TargetName)'s ship and steal a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem). Contract's very specific that they got to go. No bargains, no mercy, just one to the dome and a trip to their cargo hold. Take the stuff to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.' Now, I floated this tidbit out to the sharks and the ~mission(client) were the most interested. They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

Please understand that you will have to stay on-site for the duration of your shift. Should an emergency arise before your shift is over, you just need to resign your post at the security office before leaving.

There are a few places around the system where you could access one, but Crusader’s latest construction project, Security Post Kareah, ran into a few ‘problems’ that left it unstaffed, but still connected. Perfect place to sort yourself.

Unfortunately, it’s highly likely that if the Syndicate did organize the hit, they’ll be sending people to retrieve the black box to wipe the data, so you’ll have to hurry.\n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text=LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\n\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station. Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \n\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair. Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \n\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \n\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\n\n

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Subtitle=Personal Datapad - Dreams, Thoughts, and Inspiration
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n

We highly recommend adjusting your flight plan accordingly.\n\nCrusader Industries thanks you for your patience in this matter,\n\nLorenzo Momar\nVice President, Interstellar Communications Division, Crusader Industries

I just got the estimate from the repair crew. It’s not good. The whole air filter system is going to need to be replaced and that’s going to take some time. Not to mention getting the extra expenditure cleared by Central is going to be a bit of a to-do after the struggle we had getting the last increase through the board.\n\nI’m afraid there is no way we can proceed with opening the station as planned, and, unless you object, I’m going to keep the patrols operating out of their existing posts and delay their transfers until we have a better grasp on the updated timeline.\n\nNot going to lie, it's a major setback. I know how much having this new facility operating meant to you. Darston and myself are going to do everything we can to help get us back on track. \n\nSee you tomorrow,\nPauline\n\nPauline Nesso\n\nFacilities Manager\nCrusader Security\nSecurity Post Kareah

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

It's ridiculous. There is no way that's true. I know my husband. Darnell had his problems but that's all in the past.\n\nI want you to go Covalex and send me evidence that my husband is innocent. But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

murderspree_desc_0001=I got a bit of a sob story for you. Year ago to the day, Navy squad came and dusted some of my best. Spaced 'em in the middle of a job with nary a warnin'. Hardly seems right. \n\nNow I'm thinkin' it's about time to settle the score. Heard that there was a level 5 in system and it's too good of a chance to pass up. See, as long as your crimestat's that high, the brave little starmen are gonna be huntin' you down anytime security gets wind of ya. Here's what I say, let 'em. \n\nEvery one of them blues that comes to hunt you, you take them out first. Get ~mission(KillCount) of them and I figure that'll be justice for my crew and a fine payout for you.   \n\nOne little bit extra - once you land the first shot, I need you to do it all in a set amount of time: ~mission(KillTime). The same as it took them to wipe us out. Call me sentimental. 
murderspree_desc_0002=Since you're a level 5, I'm assuming you're one crazy bastard. Exactly the type I need to settle a bet I have going. \n\nMy idiot friend says there's no way someone could take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in ~mission(KillTime). I say that all you need is the right person for the job. Plus, as long as your crimestat stays that high, any security you run into should summon the Navy right to you. Easy pickings.  \n\nWhat do you say? Do it and half the winnings are yours. The timer starts as soon as you shoot the first one.\n\n
murderspree_desc_0003=I'm sure you're aware, but recently the Navy's been trying to clean up Stanton. As someone who's clearly no fan of the law, that's pretty bad for you, and even worse for me. I work for one of the big security firms in the system (not saying which) and all our jobs have dried up since the Navy started taking on a larger role.\n\nWhat I need is a disaster that can prove to the suits with the credits that the Navy aren't the saviors they think they are. \n\nYou're going to be my disaster.\n\nI'll pay you some serious credits to take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in under ~mission(KillTime). And with your crimestat at level 5, the heroic Navy will show up any time you run into security making it that much simpler. I’ll start the time once the first shot lands. Figure a spree of this magnitude should be enough to scare just about anyone into hiring my firm.

northrock_boarders_890J_desc_001=An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws. They would prefer to have this handled privately owing to the sensitive nature of proprietary data that's being stored aboard. \n\nYour first priority will be to clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return the ship to the owner. The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data. If you are able to stop the theft of their confidential data stores before they are transmitted, a generous bonus will be issued.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a client I would very much like to keep happy. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

northrock_bounty_desc_003=Have a bounty for you. ~mission(TargetName). Not the most high-profile collar, but a nasty piece of work nonetheless.

northrock_bounty_desc_first=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. I'm thinking I'll start you off collecting the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). \n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

They're most likely not flying together anymore, but at one point they were operating as a pretty cutthroat gang.

recoverstolen_desc_0001=We have been fortunate enough to track down a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) that recently was reported stolen. It is being held in ~mission(Location).

recoverstolen_desc_0003=This rarely happens, but believe it or not some missing property that's been our radar just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Intact too!

recoverstolen_desc_0004=After contacting us about a recent theft at ~mission(Destination), we were able to apply our tradecraft and trace their stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to ~mission(Location). All the hard work is done, all that's left is the actually physical retrieval. Think you're up for it? ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger)
recoverstolen_desc_0005=Every time you think criminals can't get any dumber, they surprise you again. These geniuses stole some~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) from ~mission(Destination) but we were able to trace it right back to their ~mission(Location). Should be a simple matter for an operator to head in, retrieve the item, and return it to its proper owners.~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryDanger) Though if I'm being honest, I wouldn't be surprised if these draggers thought it was magic or something once they notice the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is missing. 
recoverstolen_desc_0006=Good news. After a client of ours suffered a theft, we were able to trace their ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to where the criminals were holding it at ~mission(Location).

recoverstolen_space_danger_0003=Use caution approaching this perp. No telling how they might react when you get them cornered.

recoverstolen_space_desc=~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceDescription)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0001=An independent investigation has resulted in the location of a recently stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) being tracked down. We believe it to currently be in the possession of one ~mission(TargetName), an affiliate of the ~mission(client) with a known record. ~mission(contractor) is looking for a skilled individual to track down ~mission(TargetName)'s ship, recover the lost property, and return it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0002=~mission(contractor) is seeking an experienced operator to handle the retrieval of a stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) which our investagtion team has learned to be aboard the ship of known ~mission(location) affiliate; ~mission(TargetName). Once recovered, the ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) will need to be taken to its rightful owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0003=Small miracle. Some good folks over at ~mission(destination) had a ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) stolen from them, but we've actually been able to track it down. Turns out some scag by the name of ~mission(TargetName) has the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) aboard their ship right now. However, a skilled operator should be able to hunt their ship down and return the property to where it belongs. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)
recoverstolen_space_desc_0004=A ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) was reported stolen by one of the workers over at ~mission(destination). As a nice change of pace, we actually got a solid lead on the ~mission(client) member that pulled the job who's currently going by the handle: ~mission(TargetName). Now all we need is a suitable contractor to handle the recovery operation on our behalf. ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger) Serious applicants only. EDIT: ** THIS IS NOT A GUILD JOB **
recoverstolen_space_desc_0005=We have it on good authority that a stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) is currently aboard the ship of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(contractor) needs a pilot, preferably with combat experience, to retrieve the stolen property and return it to its proper owners at ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryTimed) ~mission(Danger)\n\n*This contract agreement is considered at-will, and may be terminated at any time by either party.
recoverstolen_space_desc_0006=Got a break today. After a client of ours over at ~mission(destination) got robbed, we were able to trace their stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoveryItem) to the ship of one ~mission(TargetName).

shubin_claimsweep_desc_001=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.
shubin_claimsweep_desc_002=POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA local Stanton independent mining team was working ~mission(Location) as Shubin Interstellar contractors when a hostile force attacked and took over the site. We believe that the perpetrators are still at the claim using the equipment left behind to harvest the valuable ore there for themselves.\n\nAmong the equipment lost were orbital sentries that had unfortunately not yet been fully deployed at the time of the attack. Long range scans of the claim have led us to conclude that the outlaws have activated the orbital sentries and are using them to protect their illegal operations.\n\nTo reclaim the site, we are seeking contractors to go to ~mission(Location), destroy the orbital sentries, and clear the site for Shubin repossession. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.

spacesteal_danger_0006=I'm thinking grabbing the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) should be pretty straightforward since they usually fly by themselves. But even if they do dig up an escort, it's gonna be dreg pilots at best. Nothing you should worry about, really.  
spacesteal_danger_0007=From what I remember, ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually flies this little multicrew dragbox. Shouldn't be too much trouble, but it might get tricky if they've got friends along. 
spacesteal_danger_0008=I expect that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be flying what they normally do - a small multicrew thing. The real issue will be if they decide to bring any of their friends along to fly escorts. 
spacesteal_danger_0009=Word of warning. It might take a bit of doing to get the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) since they'll be flying a pretty hefty freighter and most likely the bastards will be bringing escorts along. Cost of doing business, I suppose. 
spacesteal_danger_0010=Be mindful that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going to be carting the goods in a pretty sizeable ship. Plus, they usually spring for extra security on top of that. Not gonna lie, it won't be easy, but the haul should be worth it.

The credits are basically yours already.
spacesteal_desc_0003=Heard a few whispers that a ship's pushing off with some precious cargo aboard, but thanks to me and you, it's not going to stay that way for long. You're gonna find where ~mission(TargetName)'s ship is flying and relieve it of its burden. ~mission(Danger) Once you got it, drop the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) off at ~mission(destination) and the ~mission(Contractor|Name) will see that you're compensated for your efforts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed)
spacesteal_desc_0004=Payday! The ~mission(Contractor|Name) want a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that ~mission(TargetName) has aboard their ship and it's up to you to get it for them. Let me tell you, you're going to make some sweet, sweet creds if you're the one to bring it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) One last thing. I shouldn't even have to say this, but if you so much as think about keeping the goods for yourself, understand that you won't live long enough to enjoy it.
spacesteal_desc_0005=Attention - If your name is ~mission(TargetName), go ahead and save yourself a world of hurt and just bring the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) to ~mission(destination). If you're not that sap, then I'd like to present a business opportunity. How would you like to make some credits by chasing down ~mission(TargetName|Last) and taking the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from them? ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger)
spacesteal_desc_0006=Not sure if you remember this, but a little while back ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) boosted this amazing haul but then immediately lost it like a giant idiot. Well, everyone and their grandmother has been looking for it, but yours truly actually found it. The ~mission(Contractor|StealItem)'s aboard the ship of someone named ~mission(TargetName). Now I never heard of them, but whoever they are they're going to regret every stumbling upon that stash. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) will pay us a finder's fee if we can grab it and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Danger) Get it done and we'll both be legends.

ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_BrokenMoon=Taranis was discovered in 2478 by the famed UNE survey ship Mythic Horizon. Home to a Type-A Main Sequence star and four planets, the system only had a single high-risk candidate for terraforming in its initial scouting report. Shortly after discovery, the system was the site of a tragedy: one of Mythic Horizon’s survey boats was lost with all hands in a meteor strike.\n\nAlthough the system is sparsely inhabited, intrepid miners have been known to seek their fortune among the asteroid and lunar debris fields of the Taranis system. Criminal elements have also taken to the fields as refuge or to launch attacks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Demien=Set up shortly after the UEE claimed Nexus system, Demien was one of the operations/housing/transfer stations set up for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II. The planet was never successfully terraformed though, because the station has a much darker reputation: the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. This incident marked the first serious clash between the UEE and the criminal element that were driven out of their system.\n\nThe incident occurred in between shifts, when members of the Horizon Crew slipped aboard the station and murdered anyone they came across. One survivor managed to make it to a comm station and alert authorities. By the time they arrived, there were only outlaws left. Local authorities were significantly outgunned and were forced to call in the Marines to retake the base. The ensuing battle lasted for six hours as Marines and Criminals fought over every centimeter of territory.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_DyingStar=Modeled after the Pyro system, this lawless frontier system features a dim red dwarf known as a "flare star" at its core. Six burned-out planets remain, none of which are capable of supporting life due to the violent changes in Pyro's stellar luminosity. Between super-flare events capable of melting ice on the daytime side of Pyro IV, huge sunspots cover a large portion of Pyro's star, greatly reducing its brightness. 
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_Echo11=A former extraction facility built into the asteroid that it was burrowing into. Echo11 was built by the Hathor Group and abandoned just like they abandoned the system. Since then, it’s become a den for squatters and outlaws.\n\nRecently, it’s been used for some of the more aggressive outlaw packs to stage surgical strikes on UEE forces. The base has been launched into the public consciousness after a series of high-risk Advocacy raids attempted to take out members of Argul Dawn who had been preying on supply ships for weeks.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_NewHorizon=Built on the planet Green in Ellis system, New Horizon is home to the Empire's most expensive hotels and extravagant casinos and has just recently been cleared to host both Classic and Blitz races\n\nSituated in the lower atmosphere of Green in the Ellis system, New Horizon raceway features some of the most beloved tracks in Murray Cup history. From the classic Old Vanderval route through the Defford Link, racers of all levels flock to the system to hone their skills for a shot at glory in the Murray Cup.
ui_LoadingScreen_Desc_PU=Located in the Stanton system, the space around the planet Crusader has become a bustling hub of transports and tourism. Managed by Crusader Industries, visitors are invited to visit the lunar beauty of the three moons; Cellin, Yela and Daymar, or enjoy a relaxing vista aboard Port Olisar.\n\nTravelers are advised to keep a close eye on their scanners as criminal activity has unfortunately been on the rise for the past year.\n

ui_pregame_hangar_aeroview_history=Aeroview proudly claims to be the oldest established hangar manufacturer in Human space. Their design and construction of hangars goes back more than 300 years. In the 27th century, Arthur Nassir formed the company around a rigid code of business ethics focusing largely on design quality, a dedication to ergonomics, and an extreme respect for client confidentiality. Aeroview also famously reserves the right to refuse service to any non-Citizens. While hangar design and housing is tangential, at best, to piracy, Nassir’s outspoken contempt for those who fly outside the law led to the company’s code. When Aeroview was purchased by Shubin Interstellar, the conditions of the sale insisted that the code be adhered to in perpetuity. /n/nWhile the code remains intact, Aeroview’s original business model does not. The Aeroview hangars of the 28th century were palatial affairs built on a case-by-case basis to the specifications of the social elite capable of owning their own spacecraft. In recent years, Aeroview has adapted their tactics to follow in SELF-LAND’s footsteps (although they would never admit it). Instead of custom-building high-class hangars on an individual basis, they now produce a line of modular “business hangars” priced to sell to successful businessmen and other executive-level clients. Unlike other modular hangar companies, Aeroview does not lease the property on which their hangars are established. This is left up to the individual consumer to determine; the Aeroview hangar can be erected at any point in the UEE given 48-hours notification (24 hours, for a steep rush construction fee). Of special note, Aeroview has found particular success in developing hangars for larger scale craft or craft that require additional space for support equipment. Pilots of ships like Freelancers, with multiple crew housings, or Hornets, with weapons racks and a need for more intensive hull repair facilities, generally find it more cost effective to purchase a single Aeroview hangar rather than multiple SELF-LANDs.

ui_pregame_hangar_revelyork_history=When the Revel & York engineering corporation set about designing its first hangar some thirty years ago, the reaction was laughter. The company, known best for excessively expensive and visibly uncomfortable furniture, was entering a field dominated by aerospace giants. The laughter ceased quickly as the Revel & York “deluxe” line of hangars became the de-facto spacecraft garage of the rich and powerful. The company’s cavernous hangars, established on ideal landing spaces in top-dollar land agreements, earned their standing reputation for excellence and quality. /n/nRevel & York designers work directly with pilots to develop a hangar experience like no other. R&Y is the only company currently constructing modular hangars designed to support merchantman-class spacecraft like the Constellation and Caterpillar, locking them into a valuable if small segment of the population. Their hangar designs have earned their reputation: between interlocking catwalks (with motorized lifts!) to allow pilots to supervise their spacecraft from overhead, to specially designed Greycat PV buggies for transporting ship crews from module to module, everything is designed for not just the elite pilots’ usability but also their overall enjoyment. SELF-LAND and competitors make a place to put your ship; Revel & York makes a place for you to take it in.

ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_desc=Доступные и утилитарные Ангары имеются в каждой системе империи. Self-Land гордится тем, что обеспечивает безопасную и надежную посадку, независимо от того, находитесь ли вы на Terra или Fora. Их модульная конструкция и использование готовых материалов означает, что Self-Land ангары могут быть встроены практически в любую существующую структуру, что делает их широко  распространенными в окрестностях ОЗИ.
ui_pregame_hangar_selfland_history=Incorporated by Peter Weathermen, a wealthy guild licensed shipper who made his living on the active spacelanes, SELF-LAND hangars have become an ever-present reminder of just how easy it is for Humans to travel the stars. The corporation was founded on the philosophy that the temporary hangars available to transiting pilots were inaccessible, unaffordable and most importantly unsafe. (Weathermen began developing the company after he was jumped by a gang of dock-thugs who stripped his Starfarer to the hull plating.) /n/nStarting in the mid-29th century, SELF-LAND began a franchising-based expansion across the Human-inhabited galaxy. The first SELF-LAND was established by Weathermen on Vann in the Croshaw System. Seemingly overnight, the company had expanded to a dozen worlds … and then a hundred. Today, the SELF-LAND corporation boasts that they maintain at least one facility on every world in the UEE, with some planets (Terra chief among them) having as many as sixty different complexes. SELF-LAND hangars are fully modular and environmentally controlled. Prefabricated out of the most available common metals, they aren’t necessarily attractive to look at … but they are comfortable and familiar. The SELF-LAND experience on a colony world near Vanduul space is exactly the same as that available to a pilot berthing on Earth. The SELF-LAND corporation takes care of everything, from structure design to land titles. Because of their design, the same hangar type can be used in configurations ranging from skyscraping heights, to the breadth of a plain, to stacked underground, or to honeycombed deep within asteroids.

ui_pregame_hangar_vfgindustrial_history=Tom Vivien, Walter Fink and Ulla Gandil were members of the UEE Army Corp of Engineers who specialized in quickly building pressurized landing zones in combat zones during their service. They founded VFG Industrial shortly after being discharged and attempted to bring their expertise to the civilian market. With so many mining groups and terraformers out there, they believed there was a demand for functional and well-crafted hangars in 'non-ideal' conditions. They were correct, clients came in droves, until the Army attempted to sue them for patent theft. The lawsuit claimed that VFG's entire business was built upon proprietary design briefs written for and owned by the Army. VFG tried to settle in for a long fight, but soon began to run out of resources. With a freeze on their business, no more money was coming in, but the three refused to back down./n/nWhen things seemed bleakest, they received a reprieve, of sorts. ArcCorp was very interested in their hangar building methods, specifically for their mining and terraforming subsidiaries, but also to mass-market to the public. The members of VFG were divided. Fink utterly refused to sell to the MegaCorp, but the other two knew they had no choice. The three finally agreed to sell. ArcCorp's lawyers took over their defense and within a matter of weeks managed to work some backroom black magic to hamstring the Army's case. Fink took a substantial buyout and left the firm. Tom Vivien and Ulla Gandil are technically still on the board, but control of the company has shifted to ArcCorp.
